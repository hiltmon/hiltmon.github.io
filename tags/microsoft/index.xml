In the past I used a commercial ODBC driver. But ODBC on OS X was deprecated ages ago.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about my current stack for accessing SQL Server databases via Ruby and Python and how to set it up. Note that I do not use homebrew, so these are all native installs.</description></item><item><title>Surface Pro Pricing Madness</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/23/surface-pro-pricing-madness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 09:52:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/23/surface-pro-pricing-madness/</guid><description>I don’t get the pricing for Microsoft’s new Surface Pro.
The basic, bottom spec unit (with no keyboard, tablet form only) is $899.00. Why would you buy it when you can get full-size iPad at $499.00, or even the top-of-the line iPad at $829.00. Why would you buy it if you specifically want a Windows 8 tablet and a Samsung Activ goes for under $699.00 (and includes the keyboard).
And if you do add the keyboard for $120 (which pushes the price over $1,000) to use the Surface as a laptop, why not buy the best laptop ever made, the MacBook Air for $999.</description></item><item><title>Apple, Please make a Touchscreen Laptop</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/03/apple-please-make-a-touchscreen-laptop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2012 09:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/03/apple-please-make-a-touchscreen-laptop/</guid><description>I think Sean Hollister gets it right in The Verge article Surprisingly, touchscreen laptops don&amp;rsquo;t suck. In short, Windows 8 challenges the idea that they do not work, and proves that they do.
The argument against touchscreen laptops and desktops has always been Gorilla Arm, the idea that users will get tired holding their arms up in the air for longer interactions, they will look and feel like Gorillas.
But the theory of Gorilla Arm only makes sense when you consider it for longer interactions (for example typing or drawing).</description></item><item><title>Rarely Microsoft Office</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/07/rarely-microsoft-office/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 12:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/07/rarely-microsoft-office/</guid><description>I rarely use Microsoft Office. There, I said it. And it&amp;rsquo;s true. There are electronic cobwebs on my copy. You may now run out of the room screaming.
For many, this is like saying I rarely bathe. I rarely use Microsoft Office because I have absolutely no reason to use it except for two specific cases.
Email, not Outlook There are several reasons why I don&amp;rsquo;t use Outlook for email:</description></item><item><title>Surface Disk Free Space</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/surface-disk-free-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 15:56:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/surface-disk-free-space/</guid><description>Yikes! A 32GB Microsoft Surface RT has only 16GB free according to the Microsoft Surface FAQ. Thats 16GB for the Operating System! 5GB of that is recovery tools which could be on the net, but instead chews up expensive internal flash memory! This bloat explains the pricing and performance issues with the device. Arguably, you can expand the Surface (and Android devices) with up to 64GB more disk space using a single SD card, but that I/O is pretty slow compared to the built-in flash memory.</description></item><item><title>Surface RT is not a Duck</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 16:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/</guid><description>What is a duck? Well, if it looks like a duck, floats like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. The just-released Microsoft Surface RT fails the duck test, it looks like a tablet, but it is not a tablet. Windows 8 RT also fails the duck test, it looks like Windows 8, but it is not Windows 8.
For the record, I have used the real proper Windows 8 on a Samsung tablet before, so my impressions of the Surface and Windows RT are based on that experience.</description></item><item><title>Windows 8 Launch MIA</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 14:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/</guid><description>So I sat back today to watch the live stream of the Microsoft Windows 8 launch. I was excited, this is the first Windows launch that interested me since Windows 95. And I waited for them to show me the product, its features and its pricing. And I waited, and waited, and then the show ended. Information about Windows 8 was missing in action at the launch.
Now I know that the press has had it for ages.</description></item><item><title>Apple vs Microsoft Launch Differences</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 12:41:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/</guid><description>I started a post on the Windows 8 Launch which I will get back to later, because there were some very key differences between the two presentations and they really resounded with me. Some of them stylistic, some fundamental, you choose which.
Microsoft: “will”, Apple: “is”. A lot of the Microsoft presentation was all about “will”, you will be more productive, you will have more device choices, you will enjoy, you will do X better.</description></item><item><title>The Big 5 Windows 8 Lineups</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 09:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/</guid><description>My thoughts on announced hardware for Windows 8 being released this week.
Asus Asus will be launching their Zenbooks with touch screens for Windows 8 in November, or really replacing the screens on their old Zenbooks with touch screens and selling them as new models.
They are updating their modular tablet to run Windows RT and calling it the Vivo Tab RT. 10.1” with a dock for the low price of $599.</description></item><item><title>Why Windows Just Can’t Win</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/19/why-windows-just-cant-win/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 10:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/19/why-windows-just-cant-win/</guid><description>Mat Honan, writing in Wired in Why Windows Just Can&amp;rsquo;t Win, concludes:
It doesn’t matter if Microsoft creates the greatest operating system in the world if it then allows others to junk it up. And, ultimately, it means that Microsoft isn’t in control of its brand.
The Metro name, the crapware, and the horrible release dates all point to the same problem: Even when Microsoft has a great product on its hands, even when its product, engineering and design teams manage to hit one out of the park, it won’t matter once the business team comes in and ruins it for everyone.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Lost its Mojo</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/microsoft-lost-its-mojo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2012 09:56:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/microsoft-lost-its-mojo/</guid><description>Another well written article today in Vanity Faire, How Microsoft Lost Its Mojo: Steve Ballmer and Corporate America’s Most Spectacular Decline, which visits Microsoft’s lost decade and current structural problems. Well worth Instapering (Is that a word?).
Ballmer’s key business philosophy for Microsoft was so antiquated as to be irrelevant. The Microsoft C.E.O. used to proclaim that it would not be first to be cool, but would be first to profit—in other words, it would be the first to make money by selling its own version of new technologies.</description></item><item><title>Windows 8 Preview on a Tablet</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/windows-8-preview-on-a-tablet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 17:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/windows-8-preview-on-a-tablet/</guid><description>While on holiday, I got to play with the Windows 8 Preview on a Samsung tablet. It made some notes of the experience, then decided to wait until I returned home to see what I remembered about the experience.
The tablet itself was larger than the iPad, a lot thicker, a lot heavier and had a lot more ports. It also came with a stylus and a keyboard dock which was useful in turning it into a laptop when needed.</description></item><item><title>Building and dismantling the Windows advantage</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/building-and-dismantling-the-windows-advantage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2012 23:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/building-and-dismantling-the-windows-advantage/</guid><description>Horace Dediu, of the excellent Asymco blog, presents some interesting Mac vs PC stats in Building and dismantling the Windows advantage.
Take a look, then come back, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
In 1984, Windows was outselling Mac at 6 to 1. In 2004, it was an incredible 56 to 1. Microsoft was killing it. Microsoft had won.
But then Apple turned around. By 2010, the number had dropped to 20 to 1, still strongly in Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s favor, unless you add iPhone and iPad into the mix.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft did not always suck</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/22/microsoft-did-not-always-suck/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2012 11:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/22/microsoft-did-not-always-suck/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was a Mac when Apple was beleaguered. Those were the days when Microsoft was in ascendancy, this new Blackberry thing was cool and Google was just a search engine. It&amp;rsquo;s traditional, and expected, for us Mac people to outright disparage Microsoft and all its products as things that suck. But the reality is that Microsoft has made some pretty amazing products in spite of its size, bureaucracy and inertia. These are some of the things I think they did just right.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
