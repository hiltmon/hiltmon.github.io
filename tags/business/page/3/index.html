</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Classic article by Paul Graham in 2009 called Maker&rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&rsquo;s Schedule.
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&rsquo;re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.
There are two types of schedule, which I&rsquo;ll call the manager&rsquo;s schedule and the maker&rsquo;s schedule. The manager&rsquo;s schedule is for bosses. It&rsquo;s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the allure and popularity of freemium time-based simulation games like Farmville, DragonVale, Tap Zoo, and Smurfs Village. Yet these games are the top grossing games on the App Store. So I decided to take one on to see if I can find the &lsquo;it&rsquo; factor that makes these games so enjoyable, popular and profitable, without paying real money to short-circuit the game.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr (Too Long; Didn&rsquo;t Read)</strong>: You have got to be out of your mind to find these &lsquo;games&rsquo; enjoyable or worth spending money on. They are slow, skill and challenge lacking, chore-based, time-draining, naggy, annoying proofs of stupidity. The only conclusion I can draw from this experience is that people don&rsquo;t value their time, have no self-respect and are just plain stupid to be playing and spending money on these products. &ldquo;Men in Black&rdquo; got it right: &ldquo;A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it&rdquo;.</p>

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
<p>There are a lot of games on the iPhone App Store that offer in-app purchases of game currency in order to enable players to either speed up the game, or to buy their way to higher levels, without adding additional content. Many of these games are offered free (the <em>freemium</em> model), but make it difficult to play unless you buy these in-app coins.</p>
<p>If <em>you</em> do this, <em>you</em> are a loser.</p>
<p>If you do this, <em>I</em> too become a loser.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like being a loser!</p>

Friends, family, colleagues, I love you all, but I am not your free tech support guy. Computer programmers do not exist to fix your computer, printer or network problems, we don&rsquo;t even fix our own. Do us all a favor, and stop asking us to fix your things, or worse, just expecting us to do so. We&rsquo;re not interested. It&rsquo;s not what we do. Move along.
In the last week, I received the following requests (reminding you I work from home, alone):

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Chris Parker writing in You Are Not Ruthless Enough on being ruthless instead of lax when crafting software:
Being ruthless to yourself is having the discipline to become a better developer - not letting yourself get away with the easy or convenient. Being ruthless to your objects is having the discipline to write the API which separates their responsibilities effectively. The combination is what enables you to produce consistent results - to keep shipping, to keep creating great software, and to keep improving.

<p class=summary-body>
Troy Hunt lists the The 10 commandments of good source control management in his blog. I use git and github for eveything, including this web site and blog.
Stop right now if you’re using VSS – just stop it! If it’s not in source control, it doesn’t exist Commit early, commit often and don’t spare the horses Always inspect your changes before committing Remember the axe-murderer when writing commit messages You must commit your own changes – you can’t delegate it Versioning your database isn’t optional Compilation output does not belong in source control Nobody else cares about your personal user settings Dependencies need a home too None of these things are hard.

In Presenting a Professional Indie Image on the Noverse Blog, I present a checklist of all the things you need as an indie to present yourself to strangers via email with some credibility:
You are what you do, not what you say. &ndash; C.G. Jung
As my Hiltmon.com blog takes off, I am starting to get emails from indie developers promoting their wares. This is great, I love getting them, looking at new products and helping out where I can.

<p class=summary-body>
Lovely article by Jason Cohen, worth a read, called Your idea sucks, now go do it anyway makes a great point on how the original idea for something usually evolves into something completely different, and success comes from embracing that evolution.
“My idea isn’t good enough yet” explained a friend who is thinking of starting his own company. He’s waiting for the idea to be completely fleshed out before taking the leap.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
People desire more choices, yet are unable to choose when the selection is greater, that is the paradox of choice.
Sheena Iyengar, a professor of business at Columbia University, conducted an interesting study in 1995. She set up a display of 24 samples of jam for customers to taste, and every few hours, she switched to a 6 sample set. The results were astonishing: 60% of customers stopped to try the jams when the selection was large versus 40% when small; and 30% of those that stopped when the selection was small purchased a jam, versus 3% when the selection was large.
