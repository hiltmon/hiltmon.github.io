</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
As an experienced indie running my own business, there are things I know I am good at, things I know I am passable at and things that I simply cannot do. And one thing I will not do is enter into an engagement without a good contract. And I cannot do contracts. So one of the first things I did when I set up Noverse was to find and engage the best lawyers I could find to take care of this for me.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Daniel Jalkut asked a question on Twitter
There are over 2000 items in my Keychain. So if I want to dump/migrate to e.g. @1Password, do I really have to approve every single access?
@danielpunkass
The gang at agilebits (makers of 1Password) respond with a set of scripts to completely solve his issue, no questions asked:
@danielpunkass https://gist.github.com/1583781
@1Password
That, friends, is how Twitter support should and does work.

<p class=summary-body>
Jonathan &lsquo;Wolf&rsquo; Rentzsch wrote a great article on Mac App Store vs Buying Direct, positing that application sandboxing tips the scale in buying direct.
I always prefer to buy direct because (using his words):
More Money Goes to the Developer: For a $10 application, only $7 goes to the developer when you buy it through the Mac App Store. For a direct purchase, itâ€™s more on the order of $9.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
If I had a dollar for every time a potential customer told me that they would buy my product if it just had this one missing feature, I&rsquo;d have enough to pay rent, in a penthouse, in New York, with a view, for a year.
The assertion is that the customer would buy the product if I would implement the specified missing feature. The counterpoint assertion is that the customer perceives the product as useless without this missing feature, and the product becomes useful only because of the missing feature.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I believe that everything that a person or company delivers to another should reflect their image, style, nature, professionalism and character. Which is why the look of the Noverse Professional Services Agreement drove me mad.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. My attorney and his team are absolutely brilliant. The contract content is the best, it&rsquo;s well written, well balanced, contains all the right terms and conditions for both sides, and my clients are all very happy to sign it as is.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
My ideal vendor support line is a direct number to call the exact person I need to speak to for support. Unfortunately, this is not economic for vendors, especially since I may never call this lucky, and quite bored, person for support.
My second worst vendor support line is the most common, a 1800 number that puts one in the queue, where you wait, listening to a robotic voice tell you how long you still need to wait, like a lump.

<p class=summary-body>
Christopher Butler writes in Why Scope Creep Is Your Fault (And What You Can Do To Prevent It):
Scope creep is like slowly loading up your plate with little portions of everything on the buffet until you realize man, this plate is getting heavy and omigod I can&rsquo;t eat all of this, what was I thinking!
In essence, it&rsquo;s just as much how we manage our clients as how we manage our work.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Graham Morehead, writing in nature.com in CEOs and the Candle Problem starts:
In America we have a motivation problem : money. I&rsquo;m not a communist. I love capitalism (I even love money), but here&rsquo;s a simple fact we&rsquo;ve known since 1962: using money as a motivator makes us less capable at problem-solving. It actually makes us dumber.
Then he goes on to talk about the Candle problem and Functional fixedness, using them to explain how some CEO&rsquo;s who are improperly motivated by money drive their businesses into ruin, something we have all seen in action.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I am a huge fan of throwing together a few spike solutions at the start of a project. I get the biggest technical problems solved early, I gain understanding of any pitfalls I may encounter and I can estimate the time and work better. I highly recommend the practice. A few days spent spiking solutions saves weeks and months later.
Get your geek on, were diving in.
A spike solution is a software project to figure out a tough technical or design problem (note: singular).

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Life, communication, programming, it&rsquo;s all about structuring a rational argument. But too many people are either unable to, or are unwilling to, rationalize.
&ldquo;I hold this opinion because I&rsquo;ve read the facts and thought it through&rdquo; matters. &ldquo;I hold this opinion, and that&rsquo;s it&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t.
Ian Betteridge
Whether the argument is about creative design, system architecture, which restaurant to eat at or politics and religion, it&rsquo;s critically important to express, clarify and declare the rationalization behind it.
