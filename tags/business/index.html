</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
TL;DR: I got a job! Gonna keep writing though.
As of this week, I&rsquo;m back in the saddle in the finance industry, designing and developing leading edge platforms and systems for a new asset manager, my favorite kind of business. The challenges in the new firm are new to me and epic. And I love a good challenge.
How does this affect&mldr;
My current consulting customers? Nothing changes, all your projects are in support and the support levels will continue unaffected.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I have started a new series of articles on Hedge Fund Systems on my company, Noverse LLC blog. I did not post them here (yet) because I am not sure my readers will be interested – and I am using them to promote my skills and services. Let me know in comments you think I should post them here too.
But just in case you are interested in Hedge Fund systems (or my professional skills), the first post is called The Opportunity where I describe the opportunity I got starting in 2004 to design, develop and grow a brand new end-to-end Hedge Fund system for a completely fresh new business.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
TL;DR: Spec work is delivering creative work for free to prospective clients, encouraged by a bunch of work-listing or contest-hosting services. Say NO, even if that means you have quiet times, or you’ll never become a professional.
One of the negative things about being an indie is that the consulting and project work comes in fits and starts, and there are times, like now, when we have no client work to do at all (so contact me).

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Software estimates are hard. Clients expect things to take little time (see It Should Only Take You a Few Hours&mldr;) and cost little money. But the reality is that software is hard, there is lots to do, lots of work over and above just programming and it takes a lot more time and money to make good product. Most people underestimate the work to be done, or try to make the estimates look good, so most projects run over time and over budget because of this.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I&rsquo;ve been programming for 22 years. When I started Noverse two years ago as a professional software design and development company, I knew I would be competing against younger, cheaper programmers and masses of very cheap outsourced programmers.
A lot has happened over the past two years, and this article is about my own observations regarding the nature of this competition and how things have worked out for a lot of people I have spoken with who have chosen cheap.

<p class=summary-body>
Michael Lopp, for Rands in Repose, wrote Someone is Coming to Eat You, a brilliant article on success and competition, well worth reading.
Apple’s current biggest competitor is itself, and I think Steve Jobs learned this the hard way - from the sidelines. When he returned, one of his first hires was a gentlemen named Tim Cook, and while Tim Cook holds a degree in industrial engineering, he is not an engineer, a designer, or a poet.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
There is a huge difference between competing in a market and disrupting a market. When competing, a company tries to make a similar product in a given market segment, then competes against incumbent products on price or features to gain share and hopefully profits. When disrupting, a company produces a whole new product (or a viable derivative) that creates or changes a market, then dominates share and profits in that segment.

<p class=summary-body>
Author&rsquo;s note: This article makes no point, takes no stand and argues no single position. I wrote it to see if I could come to come conclusion on which of &lsquo;user-pay&rsquo; vs &lsquo;ad-pay&rsquo; vs &lsquo;both-pay&rsquo; makes sense, and failed. But published it anyway to see if it spurs others smarter than me to explain and solve this conundrum.
It used to be in the old days when news was delivered to your home in paper form that the only way to get coupons or know about a sale at Macy&rsquo;s was from the advertising in this newspaper.

<p class=summary-body>
It&rsquo;s been almost six months since the Codecademy launched learn to code in 2012, headlined by Mayor Bloomberg. Lots of people pledged, lots signed up.
And I&rsquo;ll be flabbergasted if any of them are still doing it.
I&rsquo;m not going to go into why having everybody learn to code is a bad thing in detail, Jeff Attwood nails that in Please Don&rsquo;t Learn to Code. Short version, it puts the method before the problem, programmers like to solve problems and create solutions, and the tool they mostly use is code.

<p class=summary-body>
Nicholas C. Zakas (@slicknet), writing in NCZOnline in The care and feeding of software engineers (or, why engineers are grumpy), writes:
And here’s the real crux of the problem: software engineers aren’t builders. Software engineers are creators. Building is what you do when you buy a piece of furniture from Ikea and get it home. The instructions are laid out and if you go step by step, you’ll get that comically small table you wanted.
