Of this I am certain.
It is going to have an absolutely beautiful design inside and out. The internal architecture is going to be sublime, the code and classes readable and maintainable. The functionality in the first version will hit all the high marks and the UI is going to stand out.
My next product is going to solve a problem that lots of other people face every day.</description></item><item><title>Someone Else Did It Better</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/03/19/someone-else-did-it-better/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 11:48:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/03/19/someone-else-did-it-better/</guid><description>Over the past year I have been working on a stealth iPad app to scratch an itch of mine. Today, following a tweeted link, I found the product I was working on, just done better by someone else.
The Product As a developer, I have a bunch of old iPhones and iPads. As a writer, I have a blog. The idea was simple: create a dashboard app to run on the old iPad 1 as a second screen to display my site&amp;rsquo;s Google Analytics using tiles so I could rearrange the view.</description></item></channel></rss>
