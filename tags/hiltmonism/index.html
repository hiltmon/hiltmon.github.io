</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
How many people really know how their motor vehicle works, or even care to. Very few.
But they all drive.
And when their car breaks down or makes a noise or that ridiculous engine light comes on, they need mechanics. Nobody, except other mechanics, understands the explanation of whats wrong with the car. And therein lies the problem.
Mechanics need to learn to talk to drivers, not mechanics.
Techs are the Mechanics Technology people are perceived to be painfully shy.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
At least once a month, step out of your cubicle or office and spend a day on the floor. It will make you a better software designer and developer, it will help you make better software for the folks on the floor, and it will build a better relationship with them so issues and ideas can flow.
I spent Friday on the floor of my work. As I do at least once a month.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Or how many people get so stuck in the processes of how to do the job, they simply forget to actually do the job. Many a product has failed to materialize because the process to make that product has gotten mired, stuck, distracted or waylaid. It becomes about the people and the politics and the process and no longer about the product.
I use this Hiltmonism to help me to focus on the goal, the reason we are creating the product, and the need to be ruthless in getting it done.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Functionality, the range of operations that can be run in a computer system, is the foundation upon which all software product collateral, designs, discussions and comparisons are based. Customers buy on functionality. Developers create functionality. Users question what the product can do.
That is fine, but it’s not the whole story.
The right question is not what operations exist (or should exist), it’s how these operations work together, how the functionality flows.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Glue is bad. Too much glue and your systems and processes become rigid, inflexible and incomprehensible. In technology and in business, you need to minimize the glue.
Let’s start with a few definitions. Lets call a potential interconnection between two systems a path. An interface is code to import or export data from an application. Now we can define an integration as a process whereby data is pulled from one interface, travels down a path and is loaded into another interface.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
There exists a common situation in business where management wants to take the business in a certain direction, but the technical and operations staff declare that it cannot be done. They then bring out a litany of reasons which boil down to two: the current systems cannot do it and current processes cannot support it. Therefore, management cannot make the change. And if management cannot make the changes, may the business cannot compete, cannot be successful and cannot continue.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
We&rsquo;ve all seen those interfaces: Internet Explorer windows with racks upon racks of toolbars, forms with hundreds of fields to fill in or applications with menus that run off the bottom of the screen, or worse, have unending levels of sub-menus. They are confusing, messy, hard to use and even harder to navigate.
This Hiltmonism is simple. One, there shall be no more than five things on an interface element. Ever!

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I was saving this one up for later, but events of this week prompted me to write it now.
Whenever something goes wrong, the first reaction of many people is to find someone else to blame. Arguments and vitriol erupt, things are said or smashed, as each team member tries to protect themselves from being blamed.
I, for one, do not ever again want to be on a team that does this.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
If we define operations as &ldquo;a piece of organized and concerted activity involving a number of people&rdquo;, then all businesses consist of a lot of operations. Back offices, accounting groups, processing units, operations departments, call them what you may, there are departments and departments of operations.
In the Automate or Die Hiltmonism, I pointed out the need to automate as much of your process flow as you can. This means tackling operations, its hordes of people, its arcane processes, its political hierarchy and its bureaucratic inertia.

<p class=summary-body>
There is no right time to start selling.
If you have a great idea, you should be talking about it, you should be selling it. If you have an alpha level product, you should be finding beta testers, you should be selling it. If you have a beta level product, you should know what the final product will look like, you should be selling it. If the product is done, you should be selling it.
