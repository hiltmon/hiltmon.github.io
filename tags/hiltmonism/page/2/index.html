</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Its not uncommon for different software systems in a company to contain the same kinds information as others. However, it is very uncommon for this information to be the same across all systems. Often the accounting system has different information than the trading system, for example. Inventory systems often have different stock levels than sales systems.
The impact of this is that traders trade on what they know, accountants report profit on what they know, and sales happens on what they know.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
You have all heard the phrase &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;. The implication being that if something is working adequately well, leave it alone.
Unacceptable!
If this were the case, we&rsquo;d still be using stone axes and living in caves, as we did for 98% of the past 100,000 years. The reason we have metal axes and houses, electricity and cars and computers and internet is because there were people out there who felt it was broke, and they found new and interesting ways to fix it.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Whether you are just hacking up a script, writing the next must-have app, or working for the man, always be writing code as if someone else has to read it and understand it. Usually, that someone else is you, six months into the future, older, wiser, with a different mindset. And you&rsquo;d hate to piss yourself off then, right?
This hiltmonism is a big one. Its easy to think you can fix something later, even though you know this mysterious later never comes.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
How many times have you opened a spreadsheet or a system, and seen pages and pages of numbers and gone &lsquo;Ugh, its too hard to find what I want!&rsquo;.
Most systems and spreadsheets try to present everything to their users, reams and reams of raw unfettered data. And most users, if you ask them, both want the data and hate the data volume that they have to deal with. Looking closer at the situation, the reason they want the raw data is because they believe they can use the data to get answers to their questions, or use the data to do their jobs.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Computers are excellent at performing dull repetitive structured tasks, yet many organizations use armies of people to perform these tasks. Computers are also great at following along the same mind numbing process over and over again (we call this programming), yet we tend as users of computers, to perform these tasks manually on our computers.
Today&rsquo;s Hiltmonism is very simple. Automate or die. Make the computer do the work so you can have a life.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
The best software designers and developers are the ones who completely understand the business and flows for which they are creating product. This understanding allows them to apply their technical skills to business problems and create great product. And the best way to understand is to be a part of the business, to be close to it.
Drawing on my career to date, the best products I have made have all come from me being right in the thick of things.
