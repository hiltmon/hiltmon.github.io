I must have written several millions of lines of production code in that time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I do not own the rights to any of the work product I have made. It all belongs to someone else. That is the way.&lt;/p>

Should we be building new product on existing, proven software stacks, or taking the challenge to start using the newer tools? In this post, I take a high-level look at the technology landscape for commercial software development to aid in a thought exercise on how I would want to create new software products.</description></item></channel></rss>
