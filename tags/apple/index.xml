But maybe, just maybe, Apple will do something like this. Or not. Maybe we will do it.
This week at WWDC, Apple surprised the developer world with their new programming language, Swift. And astoundingly, it&amp;rsquo;s almost ready for prime time Mac and iOS client software development already.
I would very much like to use a language like Apple&amp;rsquo;s new Swift on the server side as well.</description></item><item><title>The Little Touches</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/08/11/the-little-touches/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2013 15:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/08/11/the-little-touches/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the little touches that turn ordinary products into great products.
For years I have been using Power2000 NiMH batteries and their chargers that I get in Japan for use in my camera&amp;rsquo;s Flash. I use these because they really hold a charge and can handle the burst heat from a Nikon flash unit. And they store a lot of energy so they keep on flashing.
So when I moved to an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, I naturally pulled one of these sets out to use.</description></item><item><title>WWDC 2013 Post-Game Review</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/wwdc-2013-post-game-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2013 12:22:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/wwdc-2013-post-game-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just under a week ago, Tim Cook walked out on stage to present the keynote at WWDC 2013 (&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2013/">Video here&lt;/a>).

It&amp;rsquo;s maturing but still expanding, with sales growing to about 2 million a quarter.
An experienced investor, looking at fundamentals, history and buyer preferences, will expect Peach to sell 1 million Widgets and Pear to sell about 250 thousand, with the remaining Widgets being sold by others.

It turns out that this is but one of several misconceptions about the Apple App Store. So let me clarify some for you:
TL;DR
No access to buyer’s information No access to reviews No Trials and Upgrades We do not get buyers information from the Apple When you purchase an app from the App Store, Apple handles all the licensing, payment and download for us.</description></item><item><title>Priming the Pump</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/01/14/priming-the-pump/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 09:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2013/01/14/priming-the-pump/</guid><description>When it comes to stocks, priming the pump works like this:
Release a very negative article on a stock, citing rumors and anonymous sources (none of which is verifiable). Wait for the stock price to drop because your readers trust your credibility. Buy loads of the stock cheaply at the new lower price. Wait for the next earnings report to prove you wrong (which you knew already). Profit. Despicable.</description></item><item><title>1GHz Titanium PowerBook</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/12/31/1ghz-titanium-powerbook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 11:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/12/31/1ghz-titanium-powerbook/</guid><description>It was about this time 10 years ago that I purchased my precious, a 1GHz Titanium Powerbook from a back street store in Akihabara (Electric Town) in Tokyo, Japan.

In short, Windows 8 challenges the idea that they do not work, and proves that they do.
The argument against touchscreen laptops and desktops has always been Gorilla Arm, the idea that users will get tired holding their arms up in the air for longer interactions, they will look and feel like Gorillas.
But the theory of Gorilla Arm only makes sense when you consider it for longer interactions (for example typing or drawing).</description></item><item><title>Adverse Apple Articles</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/11/08/adverse-apple-articles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2012 11:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/11/08/adverse-apple-articles/</guid><description>&lt;p>As part of my research into &lt;a href="https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/">AAPL vs AMZN Performance Madness&lt;/a>, I noticed a lot of negative press on AAPL&amp;rsquo;s share price.

Apple&amp;rsquo;s is 13! In the last quarter, Apple&amp;rsquo;s earnings were up and the stock went down, whereas Amazon reported a loss and the stock went up.
When a company reports bumper earnings, I assume its stock price should rise, and when a company takes a loss, the stock price should fall. After all, the stock price is really the public valuation of the company.</description></item><item><title>Apple vs Microsoft Launch Differences</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 12:41:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/</guid><description>I started a post on the Windows 8 Launch which I will get back to later, because there were some very key differences between the two presentations and they really resounded with me.

13” Retina Macbook Pro The 13” Retina Macbook Pro looks good, is priced high as expected, and is probably going to sell very very well. But the 8GB RAM limit and the lack of an external graphics card to drive the Retina display is puzzling. The 15” has an external NVIDIA GT 650M and can go up to 16GB RAM, that makes it a pro machine.</description></item><item><title>The Post-PC future, iCloud turns one</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/14/the-post-pc-future/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2012 11:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/14/the-post-pc-future/</guid><description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCloud service turned 1-year old on October 12, 2012. The day passed with a whimper in a tech press focussed on irrelevant issues such scratching, purple flares, maps and other Apple so-called &amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo;.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a big deal, because with iCloud, Apple may finally be getting internet services right and the post-PC era just got real for most people. And no-one seems to have noticed.
As an early adopter, though, post-PC started early for me.</description></item><item><title>Scratched iPhones</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/10/scratched-iphones/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2012 10:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/10/scratched-iphones/</guid><description>There’s a big brouhaha in the news these days that new iPhone 5’s come scratched out of the box, and that the new aluminium backs scratch too easily. So much noise that Apple is trying to “fix” the problem by not shipping pre-scratched ones, and by telling people that scratching is normal for aluminium products.
I prefer Remy Labesque’s take back in 2011 in Aged to Perfection, the back of scratched iPhones can and does look beautiful.</description></item><item><title>Spent more on Patents than R&amp;D?</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2012 10:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/</guid><description>Ian Betteridge @ianbetteridge takes the New York Times down in Did Apple and Google really spend more on patents than R&amp;amp;D?, in response to the NYT article The iEconomy: Apple and Technology Manufacturing (Subscription required):
Read the NYT piece, and you would think that the technology market has shifted from being about research and development of new products to being about acquisition of patents. Given that this is based on a single year, when some very big patent portfolios came on the market in one-off deals that aren’t likely to be repeated in the future, that’s a long way from the truth.</description></item><item><title>My WWDC 2012 Scorecard</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/my-wwdc-2012-scorecard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2012 17:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/my-wwdc-2012-scorecard/</guid><description>I published my WWDC 2012 Keynote Predictions a few days ago, lets see how well I did:

Lamentations are written.
