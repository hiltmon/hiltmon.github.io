</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Note: This is not a thing, it&rsquo;s just some idle speculation on my behalf. But maybe, just maybe, Apple will do something like this. Or not. Maybe we will do it.
This week at WWDC, Apple surprised the developer world with their new programming language, Swift. And astoundingly, it&rsquo;s almost ready for prime time Mac and iOS client software development already.
I would very much like to use a language like Apple&rsquo;s new Swift on the server side as well.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
It&rsquo;s the little touches that turn ordinary products into great products.
For years I have been using Power2000 NiMH batteries and their chargers that I get in Japan for use in my camera&rsquo;s Flash. I use these because they really hold a charge and can handle the burst heat from a Nikon flash unit. And they store a lot of energy so they keep on flashing.
So when I moved to an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, I naturally pulled one of these sets out to use.

<p>Just under a week ago, Tim Cook walked out on stage to present the keynote at WWDC 2013 (<a href=http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2013/>Video here</a>). It was an astounding success. I think Apple has become Tim Cook&rsquo;s Apple, and the products announced are living proof of that.</p>
<p>After letting them percolate for a few days, here are my impressions of what was announced.</p>

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Lets take a look at the Widget market. It&rsquo;s maturing but still expanding, with sales growing to about 2 million a quarter.
An experienced investor, looking at fundamentals, history and buyer preferences, will expect Peach to sell 1 million Widgets and Pear to sell about 250 thousand, with the remaining Widgets being sold by others.
But lets assume the presence of an Analyst that wants to drive Peach&rsquo;s stock down, and wants to promote Pear.

<p class=summary-body>
<p>I think Apple&rsquo;s recent move to annual releases for major products like iOS, OS X, iPhone and iPad is a huge mistake. It opens up too many <em>cans of worms</em> and is hurting the company&rsquo;s public image and stock price.</p>

<p class=summary-body>
I have been accused of being an Apple fan-something as if this was a bad thing, a blinkered delusional existence, a sign of mental degradation. I could come back that it is a Stockholm Syndrome like relationship that binds Windows users to Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Or declare that Linux-on-the-desktop users are hallucinating when they claim productivity and usability in a sea of incomprehensibly complex, buggy and mediocre open source software.

<p class=summary-body>
I&rsquo;m not a subscriber to the Wall Street Journal, but I have noted the past few months that the WSJ seems to issue regular negative news, no, opinions, no, rumors, no, rubbish on Apple.
So I ran a test, I Googled wsj apple.
Here are the headlines that came up. I only read the blurb because the content is behind a paywall, and so include my guess as to what I expect would be in the article (and know wasn&rsquo;t):

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Over the past few days, new and old friends have been popping up to mention they purchased TimeToCall and were surprised that I did not know that they had done so.
It turns out that this is but one of several misconceptions about the Apple App Store. So let me clarify some for you:
TL;DR
No access to buyerâ€™s information No access to reviews No Trials and Upgrades We do not get buyers information from the Apple When you purchase an app from the App Store, Apple handles all the licensing, payment and download for us.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
When it comes to stocks, priming the pump works like this:
Release a very negative article on a stock, citing rumors and anonymous sources (none of which is verifiable). Wait for the stock price to drop because your readers trust your credibility. Buy loads of the stock cheaply at the new lower price. Wait for the next earnings report to prove you wrong (which you knew already). Profit. Despicable.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
It was about this time 10 years ago that I purchased my precious, a 1GHz Titanium Powerbook from a back street store in Akihabara (Electric Town) in Tokyo, Japan. I bought it based on a single viewing of another PowerBook because it ran UNIX with a GUI. Oh and it was thin and fast and beautiful.
It surely is the best device I ever owned.
I had been a Mac user in the early 1990&rsquo;s, but, like most, I moved over to Windows for work.
