</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Natsukashii (懐かしい) is a Japanese word for &ldquo;feeling nostalgic&rdquo; or &ldquo;with fond memories&rdquo;.
I happened to click on a Mike Zornek (@zorn) link today and noticed that he is still running iPulse on his desktop. I used to run it back in the early days of OS X on my Titanium Powerbook.
Back then, I had already returned to the Mac. But in 2003 or so, OS X was still very buggy and slow.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
OK, so you managed months ago to stop yourself from Premature Flexification when creating a class (or someone else did), but now the time has come to add features or flexify the existing feature set of the class.
There are many wrong ways to do this, and I have seen all of them in practice:
Duplicate the existing class, rename it and add the flexibility to the new class. This sounds great as existing code remains unaffected, but sucks if a bug is found in the original and both need to be maintained.

<p class=summary-body>
I was sitting down to design an iOS widget to display an analogue clock face for an upcoming app. I wanted to make sure, as we all do, that the widget will work for all scenarios needed by the app. The app needs to display the time in different time zones, given a reference time in a reference timezone.

<p class=summary-body>
As a developer, I often get requests from clients asking me if I could deliver them a spreadsheet using their data from their systems that contains X and Y and Z. As a maker of software products, I often get asked whether my product supports ‘Export to Excel’.
Most developers say yes, here is your spreadsheet and yes, the product has ‘Export to Excel’. My answer is different, it’s sometimes and no, and this is why.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
There was a panic at one of my client sites today when the reporting software I wrote for them stopped working. Instead of presenting reports as usual, the software threw an unknown error.
WTF, an unknown error!
I wrote the darn system, I know all the errors, because I coded all of them!
A quick glance at the logs indicated that indeed, Passenger was throwing an unknown error when accessing one Rails URL (and all others were working just fine).

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
One of the most misunderstood things in computing is the need and power of scripts. Most IT shops seek out platforms, tools and technologies to perform business functions, when a bunch of well architected and documented scripts is all that is really needed.
script /noun/
An automated series of instructions carried out in a specific order written in an interpreted computer language
Over the years, I have seen many organizations go out and buy very expensive platforms and hardware, and hire very expensive staff, without even once looking at the alternative, well managed scripts.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
There is some amazing independent software out there for the Mac. And I use a lot of it. I realized today, while fixing a problem on my wife’s laptop, that I have pretty much replaced many older products with new ones on my computer over the last year or so, yet she still uses all the old stuff.
Change is good for me. I love using new products that improve my productivity, work better or look better.

<p class=summary-body>
My favorite journaling application Day One has been updated for both Mac and iOS. Amongst the best new features are photo’s, location checkins using Foursquare and weather. They have also updated the markdown engine. I use it all day to capture what I do as well as log all my activities (such as creating this post or committing code, see Bread crumbs in Day One - The Hiltmon).
Since this new version is sandboxed, the command line client has been moved.

The online conversation on the Sparrow sale continues unabated. But in amongst all the vitriol, I found some amazing articles written long before the sale pretty much predicting how it is now. Here are some great quotes and links.
Guy English, in Software Sea Change:
An Application represents the developer’s best effort at creating software that applies the capabilities of the device to solving a specific problem. Making people laugh is not a problem an Application can solve; it’s not about the device it’s about the person using it.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
David Barnard, of AppCubby, writing in The Sparrow Problem, where he competently works out that the sales and income numbers for Sparrow were not enough to sustain the team, and therefore the business, concludes:
The age of selling software to users at a fixed, one-time price is coming to an end. It’s just not sustainable at the absurdly low prices users have come to expect. Sure, independent developers may scrap it out one app at a time, and some may even do quite well and be the exception to the rule, but I don’t think Sparrow would have sold-out if the team — and their investors — believed they could build a substantially profitable company on their own.
