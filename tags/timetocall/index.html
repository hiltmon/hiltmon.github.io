</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
In TimeToCall - After One Month, I stated that my next marketing experiment would be to send a PR style email to popular press site tip lines to see if they worked. In parallel, and unbeknownst to me, Christian Tietze was doing the same thing, just paying for it (See Sales and AppLaunch.us experience for Calendar Paste, worth a read and reminding me to post this).
The results are:
12 PR messages sent (see the actual message sent at the bottom of this post) 1 delivery failure (so I used a backup address) 2 robo-responders indicating that the emails were received, thank you 0 reviews 0 posts about the product 0 requests for promo codes 0 responses 0 sales To be clear, I do not blame any of these folks for the lack of response (and I did not really expect any).

<p class=summary-body>
TimeToCall is a simple, universal iOS application I developed to help people choose the best time to call when calling internationally. This is a follow-on to a 10 part (and growing) series I wrote about the thinking and work done. My goal is to share just how much effort it really does take to craft an iPhone app and ship it. I hope this series helps you to understand why it costs so much and takes so long to create beautiful software.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
In preparation for the massive PR campaign that will never happen, I created a demo video of TimeToCall, showing off the new &ldquo;drag down slider&rdquo;, and added it to the product page. I am hoping v1.0.1 gets approved soon so you can all play with time.
Why make a Video? There is no trial on the App Store, so the next best thing is a quick video to help people decide whether the App does what they want.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I&rsquo;ve received some great feedback and a few bug reports on TimeToCall and spent some time trying to make it a better product. The next decision is when to pull the trigger and put the first update through the App Store review process.
Changes The two big changes I have made so far are a more accurate slider and the time now toggle.
In the original release, I set the time slider to jump to 15 minute increments to make it easier to hit a &lsquo;zero&rsquo; time.
