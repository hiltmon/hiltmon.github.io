Since then, the iPad 4 and the iPad mini have launched. Surprisingly enough, the early 2012 essentials (excluding games) have changed very little:
New Additions The Magazine - Technically not an app, The Magazine is a brilliant new take on how a magazine should work, with great writing on a wide variety of interesting topics.</description></item><item><title>iPad 4G Misleading</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/27/ipad-4g-misleading/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2012 10:08:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/27/ipad-4g-misleading/</guid><description>As reported in the Verge, Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPad &amp;lsquo;4G&amp;rsquo; advertising labeled misleading by Australian watchdog, may be banned. The same can be said for the fictitious 4G on my iPhone 4S.
As a proud Aussie, I am a fan of the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) and Australia&amp;rsquo;s Trade Practices Act that supports them. In short, companies cannot lie or mislead customers in any way, or the ACCC can nail them and force them to make things right.</description></item><item><title>2012 iPad Essentials</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/17/2012-ipad-essentials/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2012 13:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/17/2012-ipad-essentials/</guid><description>Editorâ€™s Note: This was written way back in March 2012 with the launch of the iPad 3.

The new iPad arrived yesterday. Instead of restoring from a backup, I decided to build it clean and install only essential apps. Here are the ones (excluding games) that made it in the first 24 hours, pretty much in order of addition:
iBooks - I read a lot of ePub books on the iPad, and the new retina text rendering is so great.</description></item><item><title>First impressions of the new iPad</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/16/first-impressions-of-the-new-ipad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2012 14:19:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/16/first-impressions-of-the-new-ipad/</guid><description>In short, between the iPad 2 and the new iPad (retina):
Weight: Same Thickness: Same Screen: Yowser! The old screen looks pixellated and blurry, the new screen is brilliant. Also a lot warmer. Performance: Same Between the original and the new iPad (retina):
Weight: Oh, so much lighter Thickness: Oh, so much thinner Screen: As above, but the original was warmer than the iPad 2. Performance: Blazingly faster, yet the original is still no slouch.</description></item><item><title>Writing on the iPad</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/09/writing-on-the-ipad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2012 11:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/09/writing-on-the-ipad/</guid><description>This comment by JohnDoey (reproduced in full without permission) on the Asymco article The new feeds and speeds: iPad vs. MacBook Air and iMac sums up the iPad writing experience beautifully (although I think the iPad is a good production system too):
I&amp;rsquo;m a writer also. You missed a key point about writing on iPad.
Writers who are using iPads are not using them like Macs (or Mac clones,) they are using them like typewriters.</description></item><item><title>iPad - On Two Years of Use</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/09/ipad-on-two-years-of-use/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2012 09:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/03/09/ipad-on-two-years-of-use/</guid><description>Can you believe it, the iPad has been around only two years, two! Yet it feels like there was never a time before we had them.
I was one of those who pre-ordered the original iPad on launch (and the iPad 2 on its launch). I also wrote three blog posts back then, and it seems my usage patterns have not changed that much:
