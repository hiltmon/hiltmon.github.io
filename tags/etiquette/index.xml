One of my many peeves is with people who are not punctual. If we schedule a call or a meeting at a given time, I will be there, on time, prepared and ready to go.</description></item><item><title>Email Etiquette</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 15:38:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/</guid><description>&lt;p>I don’t know about you, but I get a lot of emails across a lot of accounts and the time and effort to process my inbox is growing exponentially. I just wish that senders and responders on email would follow some basic etiquette rules that will make our use of email both more pleasant and more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Email is a form of communication which is a reflection of you. Bad email etiquette reflects badly on you, and a record of this is kept in mailboxes over which you have no control. Good email etiquette reflects well on you, improves your public perception and persona and increases the chance of a prompt and comprehensive response. It’s not hard to maintain good email etiquette once you know what it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing before we start, before creating or responding to an email, ask yourself this: is email the right medium for this communication? If you are not sure, pick up the phone or wander over to the person and have a conversation. Email only if it is the right medium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And always follow good etiquette. This article contains a comprehensive list of rules and recommendations learned through experience and research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>US Aircraft Embarkation Etiquette Failures</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/05/16/us-aircraft-embarcation-etiquette-failures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 14:08:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/05/16/us-aircraft-embarcation-etiquette-failures/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just returned from a European vacation which involved flying in several aircraft from a wide variety of airports.
