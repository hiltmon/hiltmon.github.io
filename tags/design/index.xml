Unless it was to trigger a software update.
That was until last week.
Last week I was working on an odd project to create a set of web pages that would be hosted on a payment processor&amp;rsquo;s site, but must look and feel like they are running on the actual site. This was for some non-profits to enable them to accept credit-card donations and electronic payment of member fees.</description></item><item><title>How to Flexify a Class</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/12/19/how-to-flexify-a-class/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 13:19:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/12/19/how-to-flexify-a-class/</guid><description>OK, so you managed months ago to stop yourself from Premature Flexification when creating a class (or someone else did), but now the time has come to add features or flexify the existing feature set of the class.
There are many wrong ways to do this, and I have seen all of them in practice:
Duplicate the existing class, rename it and add the flexibility to the new class. This sounds great as existing code remains unaffected, but sucks if a bug is found in the original and both need to be maintained.</description></item><item><title>Premature Flexification</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/12/19/premature-flexification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 10:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/12/19/premature-flexification/</guid><description>I was sitting down to design an iOS widget to display an analogue clock face for an upcoming app. I wanted to make sure, as we all do, that the widget will work for all scenarios needed by the app. The app needs to display the time in different time zones, given a reference time in a reference timezone.

The default PT Sans and PT Serif fonts are very, very nice, but not awesome. I did like the X and Y height, the clarity, the ease of reading, but the letterspacing on the serif font was too tight and it started to look jaggy.
This week, Adobe released Source Sans Pro, their first free and open font, and I think it’s great for a technical blog-style web site.</description></item><item><title>Augmented Paper</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/04/16/augmented-paper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2012 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/04/16/augmented-paper/</guid><description>Matt Gemmell wrote yet another brilliant post on what makes a great application interface (with examples) in Augmented Paper:
For me, software experiences that feel like Augmented Paper are those that second-guess our (developers’) natural tendency to put functionality first, or to think of our apps as software. Apps are only incidentally software; software is an implementation detail. Instead, apps are experiences.
Honestly, if you are an app designer, this is a must-read.</description></item><item><title>Design needs an Advocate</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/02/07/design-needs-an-advocate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2012 08:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/02/07/design-needs-an-advocate/</guid><description>Felicity Evans, writing in the Smashing Magazine article When A Thousand Words Is Worth A Picture writes:
Design is itself a process of deduction. It involves a number of decisions, both conscious and unconscious. During this process, the designer dismisses some ideas as unworkable and pursues others in order to arrive at a solution.
But this process is completely opaque to the client. The client likely views the design not as the outcome of an in-depth process, but as a response to the brief, merely a visual representation of the constraints and considerations set before the designer.</description></item><item><title>Structure First.

Content Always.
Let’s stop siloing content, shall we? We did it for a while when we were designing a largely brochureware, templated web. Now, we’re trying to move that silo from one end of the process to the other. Let’s focus on structure to begin with, and think about content all the time. There is a symbiotic relationship between content and design.</description></item><item><title>Childlike Wonder</title><link>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/02/01/childlike-wonder/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 10:31:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.github.io/blog/2012/02/01/childlike-wonder/</guid><description>Ever watch a child with an iPad? They seem to get it immediately, they prod and tap and swipe and rotate and in no time at all seem comfortable with it.
Ever watch an adult with an iPad? They hold it, and stare at it, and, well, stare some more, and maybe wave a finger near it, but hesitate to touch. And after all that staring and hesitating, they remain uncomfortable with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
