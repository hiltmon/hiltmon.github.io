</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I was asked in a blog comment today how I decide what to write about. And once decided, how do I go about doing it. In this case, the answer was easy, I decided to try to answer the question. And deconstruct the process I go through as it happens.
Instructions: Read this post in black font first, then come back and look at the gray which deconstructs my thinking.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
When I was a child, my horizon was the building I was in, my home. I could reach out and touch my family and whomever wandered into the house.
As a teenager, I got a bicycle, and my horizon was the neighborhoods within cycling range. I could reach out and touch my friends in nearby neighborhoods. And I felt less constrained.
Later, I learned to drive, and my horizon grew to the city I was living in.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Over the past few years, I have been writing more and more on my Mac, whether it be single blog posts, blog series, systems documentation, knowledge bases and other articles. The best part is that all the tools I use are indie developed from all over the world, are amazingly great and way better than their mainstream counterparts.
In this post, I want to share the tools I use to write and why I choose them.

<p class=summary-body>
I totally agree with Marco in Avoiding the blogger trap:
People aren’t so one-sided. Everyone has a life that goes much deeper than the topics on their blogs.
and
This site represents me, and I’m random and eccentric and interested in a wide variety of subjects.
This site is me, with a hodge podge of posts ranging from opinion pieces, news, geeky ideas, advice, links, jokes, setups and productivity.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
Most people when they click on a link to a new blog, read the linked article and move on elsewhere. Google Analytics records this as a bounce - a visitor comes in, reads a single page and leaves.
One of my habits when I come across a new blog is to read the archives. Almost every blogging platform has archives and almost every blogger makes these available.
But why read the archives?

<p class=summary-body>
Today, April 30, 2013 is the 20th anniversary of CERN making the WWW free, see Twenty Years of a free, open web. I thought I&rsquo;d share a story about how it was like before then.
The year was 1988 or 1989, and my Computer Science Professor wanted to send his first email. But first we had to connect our University to the fledgling Internet. Since I ran the UNIX lab, I was tasked to set this up.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
We&rsquo;re not perfect, yet:
You can only learn from making perfectly good mistakes.
We all know of people&rsquo;s reluctance to try things out in new software products because they are afraid of making mistakes and looking foolish. They are striving for perfect execution, yet unknowingly fail to learn the product or gain the benefits of its power.
Yet the failure to try new things is the biggest mistake of all.

Adjective
Happening or doing something at the agreed or proper time; on time. Denoting or relating to an action that takes place at a particular point in time. Synonyms

One of my many peeves is with people who are not punctual. If we schedule a call or a meeting at a given time, I will be there, on time, prepared and ready to go.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
I often come across users who tell me they just have to have something in the software I am designing for them: some data or a report or an export. When I ask them how they use this requested item, or why they need it, they usually answer that they just have to have it. Sometimes, they even try to justify the request using the excuse that they have always had it, so they should continue to have it.

<p class=summary-body>
I have been accused of being an Apple fan-something as if this was a bad thing, a blinkered delusional existence, a sign of mental degradation. I could come back that it is a Stockholm Syndrome like relationship that binds Windows users to Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Or declare that Linux-on-the-desktop users are hallucinating when they claim productivity and usability in a sea of incomprehensibly complex, buggy and mediocre open source software.
