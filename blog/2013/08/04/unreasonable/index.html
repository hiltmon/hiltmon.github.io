Unreasonable</h1><div class=writing-body><p>There are two ways to deal with &ldquo;the ways things are&rdquo; in an environment where one <em>can</em> change them:</p><ul><li><p>Find some way to justify or meekly accept them, however twisted and delusional they may be; and try to get on with things within those perceived constraints. <strong>They call this being reasonable</strong> as if it were a good thing.</p></li><li><p>Or find a better, considered, simpler way for things, which requires effort, argument, time, and sometimes blood; enabling one to actually get on with things with fewer constraints. <strong>They call this being unreasonable</strong> is if it were a bad thing.</p></li></ul><p>The <em>reasonable</em> person in this context makes up, believes and is required to publicly support their own justifications. The <em>reasonable</em> person believes &ldquo;The boss is always right.&rdquo;, or &ldquo;They pay me to do, not to think.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there is a reason why I have to perform this mind-numbing process.&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always done it that why, so if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo; They <em>assume</em> that they cannot change &ldquo;the ways things are&rdquo;.</p><p>Sounds pretty <em>unreasonable</em> to me. It&rsquo;s a cop-out. Bad for the person, bad for the business. I am a boss, and I am most certainly not always right! And many many processes have no purpose at all.</p><p>Progress, innovation, change, joy and great software depend on being <em>unreasonable</em>. They depend on thinking about what one does, questioning it, challenging it. They depend on identifying the underlying assumptions and justifications and then tearing them apart, regularly. If the &ldquo;way things are&rdquo; stack up after that tremendous attack, then maybe, just maybe, they can stay, for now. But the &ldquo;way things are&rdquo; rarely do.</p><p>Thanks to the <em>unreasonable</em> people out there we have an Internet and mobile phones and rovers on Mars. Thanks to the <em>reasonable</em> people out there we have bureaucracies and paper forms and religions and borders.</p><p>In my case, it was not <em>reasonable</em> to strive to gain an education that got me out into the world, it was not <em>reasonable</em> to go and live and work and experience life on three continents after leaving my original one, and it was not <em>reasonable</em> to design and create innovative hedge-fund systems for my bosses. The <em>reasonable</em> thing to do was to stay where I was, live where I was and do what I was told.</p><p>Boring. Sad. What a waste of a life it would have been.</p><p>Now is not the time to get all <em>reasonable</em> again and protect the status quo. It&rsquo;s time to get more <em>unreasonable</em>, to accelerate the rate of change and innovation. It&rsquo;s time to rethink everything, challenge all assumptions, tear down all rote justifications. We have the technology, the knowledge and the ability.</p><p>And I for one look forward to what we <em>unreasonable</em> people can come up with. There is nothing we <em>unreasonable</em> people cannot change, improve or fix if we set our minds to it.</p><p><em>Follow the author as <a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a> on Twitter and <a href=http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a> on App.Net.
