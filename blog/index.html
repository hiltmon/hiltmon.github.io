Frequently though, the code review focusses wholly on the code and on an eyeball search for potential bugs and no more. There is a better way.
As developers, we read and write code all day, it&rsquo;s our superpower and wholly inside our comfort zone.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2022/08/10/code-review-is-not-all-about-the-code/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 7, 2020 11:00 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/06/07/working-from-home-88-days-later/>Working from Home ... 88 Days Later</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Follow on post to Working From Home &mldr; Here We Go! written in March.
88 Days ago in New York we all started working from home. 88 Days ago we stopped commuting, sat down for the first time at our fledgeling home workspaces, launched our first Zoom or Slack meetings and started figuring out how best to do our jobs from there. 88 Days later, we&rsquo;re still doing it and will be for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/06/07/working-from-home-88-days-later/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 14, 2020 9:57 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/03/14/working-from-home-dot-dot-dot-here-we-go/>Working from Home ... here we go!</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It’s been many years since I worked from home and much is different since I ran Noverse from here. First, my wife has taken over my workspace as hers, so the desk, good keyboard, mouse and monitor are her domain now. Secondly, it’s likely this is not a one-day disaster recovery test, so I need to find a way settle in instead of use the laptop on the dining table. And thirdly, Slack has changed the way we communicate internally, which makes it as easy to maintain contact as it does in our open plan office.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/03/14/working-from-home-dot-dot-dot-here-we-go/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 31, 2019 2:14 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/12/31/the-theater-was-empty/>The Theater was Empty</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Johannesburg, 1977 It was a crisp, sunny Saturday morning and my grandmother was in town. As we always did when together, we went to the movies. The theater nearby was old, run down but comfortable and in walking distance. I&rsquo;d go there later again many times on many Saturday mornings.
For the first time, though, I was more excited about the movie than I was about going with grandmother. I was about to turn 10.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/12/31/the-theater-was-empty/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 16, 2019 11:36 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/02/16/an-ipad-and-a-pencil/>An iPad and a Pencil</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In 2018, I switched to using an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil when not using my computer, replacing notebooks, scraps of paper, Post-It notes, and ink-leaking pens.

For a while now, I have been using Catch2 as my Unit Testing framework, and its absolutely excellent. But its not integrated into the Xcode IDE and I wanted the ability to use Xcode&rsquo;s excellent testing and test debugging tools to improve my productivity and workflow.
In this post I will show you how to set up a simple standard C++17 library project in Xcode 10 and then add XCTests to it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/02/09/testing-c-plus-plus-17-project-in-xcode-with-xctest/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 17, 2018 9:58 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2018/06/17/on-removing-comments/>On Removing Comments</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today I removed the comments from hiltmon.com for one reason and one reason only — the comment service, Disqus, that I used — was tracking you across a multitude of sites and is selling your data to strangers without your (or my) permission.
