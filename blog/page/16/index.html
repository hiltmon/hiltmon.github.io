Unless it was to trigger a software update.
That was until last week.
Last week I was working on an odd project to create a set of web pages that would be hosted on a payment processor&rsquo;s site, but must look and feel like they are running on the actual site. This was for some non-profits to enable them to accept credit-card donations and electronic payment of member fees.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/12/a-coda-2-use-case/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 8, 2013 5:30 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/08/octopress-now-has-footnotes/>Octopress now has Footnotes</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If you update to the latest Octopress and you still use the rdiscount markdown processor, you now get footnotes like this 1. I was previously using a CSS workaround because I prefer the speed of rdiscount for my growing site2 and still wanted footnotes.
To create a footnote, use the standard MultiMarkdown [^1] anchor to create the footnote reference link, and add [^1]: The footnote content. to the bottom of the file3.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/08/octopress-now-has-footnotes/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 8, 2013 10:43 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/08/avoiding-the-blogger-trap/>Avoiding the Blogger Trap</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I totally agree with Marco in Avoiding the blogger trap:
People aren’t so one-sided. Everyone has a life that goes much deeper than the topics on their blogs.

This site represents me, and I’m random and eccentric and interested in a wide variety of subjects.
This site is me, with a hodge podge of posts ranging from opinion pieces, news, geeky ideas, advice, links, jokes, setups and productivity. I write what I find interesting.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/08/avoiding-the-blogger-trap/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 7, 2013 9:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/07/reading-the-archives/>Reading the Archives</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Most people when they click on a link to a new blog, read the linked article and move on elsewhere. Google Analytics records this as a bounce - a visitor comes in, reads a single page and leaves.
One of my habits when I come across a new blog is to read the archives. Almost every blogging platform has archives and almost every blogger makes these available.
But why read the archives?</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/07/reading-the-archives/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 6, 2013 12:45 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/06/hedge-fund-systems/>Hedge Fund Systems</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have started a new series of articles on Hedge Fund Systems on my company, Noverse LLC blog. I did not post them here (yet) because I am not sure my readers will be interested – and I am using them to promote my skills and services. Let me know in comments you think I should post them here too.
But just in case you are interested in Hedge Fund systems (or my professional skills), the first post is called The Opportunity where I describe the opportunity I got starting in 2004 to design, develop and grow a brand new end-to-end Hedge Fund system for a completely fresh new business.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/06/hedge-fund-systems/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 1, 2013 1:04 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/01/fix-the-mac-function-keys-with-palua/>Fix the Mac Function Keys with Palua</a></h1><p class=summary-body>By default, the function keys on Apple keyboards are mapped to the Apple functions on them, like brightness, volume and Mission Control. To access them as F1 - F12 requires you to hit the fn key as well. You could always reverse this in Preferences / Keyboard by checking Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.
But this change is system-wide. What if you want the default Apple behavior most of the time, but Function key behavior in certain applications, for example, in virtual machines?</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/01/fix-the-mac-function-keys-with-palua/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 1, 2013 11:28 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/01/instantly-grab-a-high-res-icon-for-any-mac-app/>Instantly grab a high-res icon for any Mac app</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In Instantly grab a high-res icon for any iOS app, the awesome Brett Terpstra (@ttscoff) offered a script and an app to get the icon from iTunes for any iOS app.
I wanted the same for Mac apps. Turns out, it&rsquo;s a one word change to Brett&rsquo;s scripts. Just follow his instructions using the below files, but replace the script name with macicon.rb and the application name with MacIcon.
Download and save the script as macicon.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/01/instantly-grab-a-high-res-icon-for-any-mac-app/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 30, 2013 9:09 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/30/email-before-the-open-web/>Email before the Open Web</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, April 30, 2013 is the 20th anniversary of CERN making the WWW free, see Twenty Years of a free, open web. I thought I&rsquo;d share a story about how it was like before then.
The year was 1988 or 1989, and my Computer Science Professor wanted to send his first email. But first we had to connect our University to the fledgling Internet. Since I ran the UNIX lab, I was tasked to set this up.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/30/email-before-the-open-web/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 29, 2013 7:49 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/29/hiltmonism-the-process-is-not-the-product/>The Process is not the Product</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Or how many people get so stuck in the processes of how to do the job, they simply forget to actually do the job. Many a product has failed to materialize because the process to make that product has gotten mired, stuck, distracted or waylaid. It becomes about the people and the politics and the process and no longer about the product.
I use this Hiltmonism to help me to focus on the goal, the reason we are creating the product, and the need to be ruthless in getting it done.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/29/hiltmonism-the-process-is-not-the-product/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 28, 2013 11:25 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/28/my-workspace/>My Workspace</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have no idea why I am sharing this, but this is my current workspace:
