We travelled to three European destinations with four iPhones, two iPads, a MacBook Pro and two plug adapter sets. Here&rsquo;s how they performed.
The MacBook Pro I brought the laptop along &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; I needed to jump in and fix any software issues while away.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/15/recent-travels-and-tech/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 26, 2012 9:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/application-context-packs/>Application Context Packs</a></h1><p class=summary-body>When developing in Rails, I use a certain pack of applications; when coding for iOS, I use a different pack of applications; and when in a blogging context, I use a third pack of applications. And then there is the regular set of applications that I usually leave running. Starting and switching between these contexts used to take time, until I found a better way.
The Old Way
After a clean reboot, I would then have to go through the same dance every time, launch the regular applications manually.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/application-context-packs/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 26, 2012 9:22 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/my-iphone-home-screen/>My iPhone Home Screen</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have noticed of late a trend in people or sites showing off their iPhone home screens, the first page on your iPhone with the dock, and explaining why they rearranged the applications and icons. Some have even moved the Phone.app off their home screens.
They are all doing it, so it must be cool.
My home screen on the iPhone is factory original. All the applications are exactly in the same place that Apple put them when the iPhone was first set up.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/my-iphone-home-screen/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 25, 2012 1:00 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/25/why-scope-creep-is-your-fault/>Why Scope Creep is your fault</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Christopher Butler writes in Why Scope Creep Is Your Fault (And What You Can Do To Prevent It):
Scope creep is like slowly loading up your plate with little portions of everything on the buffet until you realize man, this plate is getting heavy and omigod I can&rsquo;t eat all of this, what was I thinking!
In essence, it&rsquo;s just as much how we manage our clients as how we manage our work.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/25/why-scope-creep-is-your-fault/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 25, 2012 12:56 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/25/this-industry-is-full-of-crap/>This Industry Is Full Of Crap</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Lovely rant by Amber Weinberg in This Industry Is Full of Crap:
We get to do something that regular people can’t understand so we’re think we’re cool. We’re not.
And I&rsquo;m right with her on this too:
I love the fact that as a freelancer, I can choose who ever I want to work with – both in terms of clients and other freelancers.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 22, 2012 11:27 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/22/microsoft-did-not-always-suck/>Microsoft did not always suck</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I was a Mac when Apple was beleaguered. Those were the days when Microsoft was in ascendancy, this new Blackberry thing was cool and Google was just a search engine. It&rsquo;s traditional, and expected, for us Mac people to outright disparage Microsoft and all its products as things that suck. But the reality is that Microsoft has made some pretty amazing products in spite of its size, bureaucracy and inertia. These are some of the things I think they did just right.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/22/microsoft-did-not-always-suck/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 21, 2012 6:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/21/us-dining-etiquette-failures/>US Dining Etiquette Failures</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I&rsquo;ve been living in New York for almost nine years, and I love to go out and eat at all the myriad of restaurants that pepper this town.

Wow, worked out great, one less known unknown to deal with. Turns out, CoreGraphics does a lot of what you can do in PhotoShop, just in real time and on the GPU.
The following snaps were generated on the fly, quickly, using code, no image or artwork required, and the values change and update dynamically.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/19/spike-ui-teaser/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 19, 2012 1:58 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/19/the-news-routine/>The news routine</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Twitter, Facebook, RSS, all wonderful services, all bombarding us with information, all taking time and attention away from things we should be doing.

For me, software experiences that feel like Augmented Paper are those that second-guess our (developers’) natural tendency to put functionality first, or to think of our apps as software. Apps are only incidentally software; software is an implementation detail. Instead, apps are experiences.
Honestly, if you are an app designer, this is a must-read.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/16/augmented-paper/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.social/@hiltmon rel=me>Mastodon</a> &#183;
