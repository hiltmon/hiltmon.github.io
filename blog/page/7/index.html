Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s becoming the most popular and common programming paradigm amongst younger programmers, leading to (1) shockingly shoddy, bug laden, slow, incomprehensible, unmaintainable programs that work only once, and (2) to programmers who do not understand what they are doing, their work and how to solve problems.
For example1, one of my interns came into my office this week to see if there was a way to do dates and times easily in C++.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/01/17/stackoverflow-programming/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 14, 2015 6:42 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/01/14/write-timestamps-containing-millisecond-to-mongodb-in-c-plus-plus-11/>Write Timestamps containing Milliseconds to MongoDB in C++11</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It took me several hours today to figure this one out, so I thought I&rsquo;d write it up lest I forget.
I have a C++11 application that rapidly writes new documents to a MongoDB instance and I need high-resolution timestamps to determine the order things were written.
The problem is that the C++ standard time_t structure reports in seconds, so
builder.appendTimeT("updated_at", std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(std::chrono::system_clock::now()) ); creates an ISODate without milliseconds in MongoDB.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/01/14/write-timestamps-containing-millisecond-to-mongodb-in-c-plus-plus-11/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 11, 2014 9:35 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/12/11/coderunner-2/>CodeRunner 2</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Nikolai Krill released a major update to CodeRunner today, and I highly recommend it to all programmers no matter what languages you use.
In my case I write a lot of code in C++, Objective-C, Ruby, Javascript and HTML as part of large, complex projects. Often I am unsure how best to write a snippet or function. One way would be to create a branch in the project, run and experiment, deal with compiling, branch again to try another solution, compile some more and work it out.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/12/11/coderunner-2/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 15, 2014 3:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/11/15/what-to-write-about-next/>What to write about next?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I was asked in a blog comment today how I decide what to write about. And once decided, how do I go about doing it. In this case, the answer was easy, I decided to try to answer the question. And deconstruct the process I go through as it happens.
Instructions: Read this post in black font first, then come back and look at the gray which deconstructs my thinking.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/11/15/what-to-write-about-next/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 26, 2014 5:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/26/lose-the-www/>Lose the WWW</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have finally removed the www from hiltmon.com. The 1990&rsquo;s have passed and www no longer makes sense in URL&rsquo;s. Maybe it&rsquo;s time you did the same to your site too.
What triggered this change was that, as of 14 October 2014, Google Analytics started throwing an error if you had links to www.yoursite.com and yoursite.com. This is because it treated links with www and without as different.
Removing the www was easy.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/26/lose-the-www/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 26, 2014 2:34 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/26/simple-c-plus-plus-testing-with-catch-in-xcode/>Simple C++ Testing with Catch in Xcode</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Catch is a simple, open-source, dependency-free unit testing framework for C++ projects. In this post I show you how to use it in a Simple C++ Project from Xcode.
Why Catch? I am writing fast C++ libraries for work and need to wrap them in unit tests to ensure that they continue to operate and perform as they evolve. My number one constraint is that these libraries must be dependency-free.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/26/simple-c-plus-plus-testing-with-catch-in-xcode/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 18, 2014 12:44 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/18/gist-textmate-bundle-updated-for-yosemite/>Gist TextMate Bundle updated for Yosemite</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Thanks to Michael Sheets, the Gist TextMate bundle now works in TextMate 2 on Yosemite. The issue was that the UI code in TextMate 2 relied on Ruby 1.8, and Ruby 1.8 is deprecated and no longer installed in OS X 10.10.
Michael created a shim to fake Ruby 1.8 until such time as the code base moves to Ruby 2.0, implemented the change in the Gist bundle and it&rsquo;s working now.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/18/gist-textmate-bundle-updated-for-yosemite/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 18, 2014 12:02 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/18/create-a-bootable-os-x-installer-drive/>Create a Bootable OS X Installer Drive</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Dan Frakes (@DanFrakes), previously of MacWorld fame, provides easy to follow instructions on how to create a bootable OS X 10.10 Yosemite installer USB drive on his personal blog.

I did not update it for iOS 7 (or iOS 8) and it&rsquo;s starting to look shabby. I never made any worthwhile money from it or received blog pageviews from it. There are newer and better products out there. I do not want to clutter the App Store with yet another abandoned product. It no longer showcases my development capabilities, they are far better now.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/02/timetocall-removed-from-app-store/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 1, 2014 9:09 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/01/any-hint-of-humanity-is-valued/>Any hint of humanity is valued</a></h1><p class=summary-body>For decades we have had corporatization, mass-production, and everything becoming the same, having personality drained from it.

[interruption edited out]
&mldr; I think the reason why everyone loves all this hand-made crap today is because they are starved for authenticity after decades of mass-market personality-less crap, and they are starved for uniqueness, they are starved for personality and they are starved for authenticity and for people to talk to them like, you know, talked to like an adult please.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/01/any-hint-of-humanity-is-valued/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
