Whether the domain names are local or foreign, infringing or not, or even valid but caught-in-the-net business sites is immaterial. They are ordered seized and taken down without notice or recourse.
Of course, there is no law to force a registry to change ownership, nor a law to require the search engines to delist in this way, but the judge ordered it anyway.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/29/hundreds-of-sites-ordered-deindexed/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 28, 2011 5:10 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/28/the-readable-future/>The readable future</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brent Simmons nails it again in The Readable Future, talking about the tools we all use to bypass all the ads and clutter of publisher&rsquo;s sites.
The future is, one way or another, readable.
Because that’s what readers want, and because the technology is easier to find and use and learn than ever. That trend will continue because developers live to give people technologies that make life better.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 28, 2011 11:16 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/28/copycats/>Copycats</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Matt Legend Gemmell writing on Copycats:
There’s an entire spectrum of terms available besides ‘copied’, ranging from “inspired by” to “plagiarised”, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing to be influenced by the work of others. The key is to ensure that you’re consciously agreeing with a design, rather than just aping (mimicking unthinkingly - a definition which no doubt does our hairy cousins a grave disservice). Sadly, much of the technology sector simply apes.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/28/copycats/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 27, 2011 6:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/27/almost-no-one-changes-their-settings/>Almost no-one changes their settings</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Following up on my recent I just want a Hamburger post, I came across a wonderful article by Jared Spool entitled Do users change their settings?.
In line with that I said about developers thoughtfully making decisions on options for their users, Jared makes some beautiful points
Less than 5% of the users we surveyed had changed any settings at all.
Why?
They assumed Microsoft had delivered it turned off for a reason, therefore who were they to set it otherwise.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/27/almost-no-one-changes-their-settings/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 27, 2011 11:01 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/27/you-hate-your-customers/>If your site does ..., you hate your Customers</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>There has been a lot of talk on the Internet lately on the inability for web site visitors to actually read the content on publisher&rsquo;s pages because of all the annoyances and clutter on these pages.

As with most meme&rsquo;s, this one is only somewhat true. They did have an itch.
