In line with that I said about developers thoughtfully making decisions on options for their users, Jared makes some beautiful points
Less than 5% of the users we surveyed had changed any settings at all.
Why?
They assumed Microsoft had delivered it turned off for a reason, therefore who were they to set it otherwise.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/27/almost-no-one-changes-their-settings/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 27, 2011 11:01 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/27/you-hate-your-customers/>If your site does ..., you hate your Customers</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>There has been a lot of talk on the Internet lately on the inability for web site visitors to actually read the content on publisher&rsquo;s pages because of all the annoyances and clutter on these pages.

As with most meme&rsquo;s, this one is only somewhat true. They did have an itch.

They’re filled with ads and social-media sharing buttons — and more ads. And Google plus-onesies and Facebook likeys. And also more ads. Plus tweet-this-es. Plus ads. (And, under-the-hood, a whole cruise-ship-full of analytics. The page required well-more than 100 http calls.)
No wonder we all like InstaPaper and Safari&rsquo;s Reader mode.
