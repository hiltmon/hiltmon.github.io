Do workers in Foxconn factories who build products for Apple, Dell, HP, and others, work long hours at tedious tasks? Yes they do. Do they work for a fraction of what a worker in the US, Japan, or even Korea would? Yes they do.
Are they being enslaved? Clearly, they are not.
I suspect that a lot of the heat from the recent press comes from a lack of understanding about Chinese culture, their rapid change from manual agrarian life to high-tech manufacturing, and the significant differences and scales of our economies.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/cheap-iphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 3, 2012 10:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/news-logic/>News Logic</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Paddy Harrington, writing in Wanna Figure Out If Your Product Is Any Good? Think Like A News Editor
At its heart, news logic is about value creation and the primacy of the design output instead of a story that traditionally gets applied after the fact. Where in the old days (i.e., five years ago), you designed something and then told a story about it in the hopes that it was a story worth telling, more and more of tomorrow’s design projects will have a story worth telling built into their hearts right from the get-go.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/news-logic/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 1, 2012 10:41 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/the-paradox-of-choice/>The paradox of choice</a></h1><p class=summary-body>People desire more choices, yet are unable to choose when the selection is greater, that is the paradox of choice.
Sheena Iyengar, a professor of business at Columbia University, conducted an interesting study in 1995. She set up a display of 24 samples of jam for customers to taste, and every few hours, she switched to a 6 sample set. The results were astonishing: 60% of customers stopped to try the jams when the selection was large versus 40% when small; and 30% of those that stopped when the selection was small purchased a jam, versus 3% when the selection was large.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/the-paradox-of-choice/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 1, 2012 10:31 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/childlike-wonder/>Childlike Wonder</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Ever watch a child with an iPad?

Ever watch an adult with an iPad? They hold it, and stare at it, and, well, stare some more, and maybe wave a finger near it, but hesitate to touch. And after all that staring and hesitating, they remain uncomfortable with it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/childlike-wonder/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 29, 2012 11:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/29/fragility-of-free/>Fragility of Free</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A great article by Ben Brooks called Fragility of Free, well worth a read:
The fragility of free is a catchy term that describes what happens when the free money runs out. Or — perhaps more accurately — when the investors/founders/venture capitalists run out of cash, or patience, or both. Because at some point Twitter and all other companies have to make the move from ‘charity’ to ‘business’ — or, put another way, they have to make the move from spending tons of money to making slightly more money than they spend.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/29/fragility-of-free/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 26, 2012 11:09 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/test-driven-development-really-works/>Test Driven Development Really Works</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In 2008, Nachiappan Nagappan, E. Michael Maximilien, Thirumalesh Bhat, and Laurie Williams wrote a paper called “Realizing quality improvement through test driven development: results and experiences of four industrial teams“ (PDF link). The abstract:
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that has been used sporadically for decades. With this practice, a software engineer cycles minute-by-minute between writing failing unit tests and writing implementation code to pass those tests. Test-driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile software development methodologies.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/test-driven-development-really-works/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 26, 2012 10:30 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/where-the-light-is-better/>Where the light is better</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A woman comes across a man crawling under a street lamp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my car keys,&rdquo; he explains.
The woman tries to help the man find his keys. After a few minutes of searching, she asks &ldquo;Where exactly did you drop them?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Down the street, next to my car.&rdquo;
Puzzled, she asks &ldquo;Then why aren&rsquo;t you looking over there?&rdquo;
&ldquo;The light is better here.&rdquo;
People often look where it seems easiest or most convenient to look, rather than in a more difficult, but more correct place.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/where-the-light-is-better/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 26, 2012 10:18 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/less-wasting-time/>Less Wasting Time</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The sub-theme this week is on trying to find ways to improve developer happiness and to reduce unpleasant time wasters.
Rafe Colburn in Don’t order your team to work more hours talks about bosses who ask staff to work more hours:
Every time you’re tempted to do so, sit down with members of the team and ask them how many hours a week they spend dealing with stuff not related to shipping and work to make those things go away instead.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/less-wasting-time/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 24, 2012 9:38 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/24/trade-trade-secrets/>Trade Trade Secrets</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A brilliant essay by Danielle Fong called Trade Trade Secrets, very worth a read, covers everything from Intellectual Property, to explaining the differences between theft, transcription, transformation and inspiration, to how the law stifles all four of them.
The great danger of laws that ignore these is not that they will prevent theft, but that they will so heavyhandedly prevent transformation and inspiration: the engines of our entire civilization.
