If you’re primarily in the market for an e-reader, get an e-ink device. And if you’re looking for a tablet for apps, games, and videos in addition to reading, unless the iPad’s price is absolutely out of the question forever, I suggest getting the iPad.
And the e-ink winner unsurprisingly is the current Kindle (called the Kindle 4 in the review).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/e-reader-roundup/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 2, 2011 6:47 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/no-service-competition-in-new-york/>No Service Competition in New York</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Just a quick check on my choices for 21st century data services available at my apartment in New York city:
Internet, Landline, Television Time Warner Cable Verizon FIOS Oops, only TWC from today based on the agreement reached where Verizon quit the land-based business (See Susan Crawford&rsquo;s article: Smug and chagrined). So no choice.
Mobile Phone AT&T Verizon T-Mobile (still a dead spot after 8 years) Sprint (same as T-Mobile) Neither work well, so I have to stick with AT&T because at least they have a MicroCell.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/no-service-competition-in-new-york/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 2, 2011 6:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/data-caps-dont-work/>Data caps don't work</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Nate Anderson, writing for Ars Technica in Data caps a &ldquo;crude and unfair tool&rdquo; for easing online congestion
Internet providers argue that they need to impose monthly data caps on their users in order to slay the &ldquo;bandwidth hogs&rdquo; running wild and free through their networks, goring ordinary users with their tusks when all those users want to do is view some funny cat pictures online after a tough day at the office.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/data-caps-dont-work/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 2, 2011 9:48 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/explain-the-problem/>Explain the Problem - Not your Solution</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Something that drives me quite batty is when people turn to me for help and request a solution without explaining the problem. In other words, they tell me their answer to a puzzle, without explaining what the puzzle is, and expect me to understand what to do. They want the answer to be 42, but what is the question being asked?
This happens a lot in software design.

This understanding allows them to apply their technical skills to business problems and create great product. And the best way to understand is to be a part of the business, to be close to it.
Drawing on my career to date, the best products I have made have all come from me being right in the thick of things.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/01/hiltmonism-close-to-the-business/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 29, 2011 10:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/29/on-designing-web-applications-balancing-identity/>On Designing Web Applications balancing Identity, Usability and Familiarity</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Graphic design without understanding the user, the flow and site interaction leads to pretty, uniquely identifiable web applications that are quite unusable and fail to connect with their users.

Whether the domain names are local or foreign, infringing or not, or even valid but caught-in-the-net business sites is immaterial. They are ordered seized and taken down without notice or recourse.
Of course, there is no law to force a registry to change ownership, nor a law to require the search engines to delist in this way, but the judge ordered it anyway.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/29/hundreds-of-sites-ordered-deindexed/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 28, 2011 5:10 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/28/the-readable-future/>The readable future</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brent Simmons nails it again in The Readable Future, talking about the tools we all use to bypass all the ads and clutter of publisher&rsquo;s sites.
The future is, one way or another, readable.
Because that’s what readers want, and because the technology is easier to find and use and learn than ever. That trend will continue because developers live to give people technologies that make life better.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 28, 2011 11:16 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/28/copycats/>Copycats</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Matt Legend Gemmell writing on Copycats:
There’s an entire spectrum of terms available besides ‘copied’, ranging from “inspired by” to “plagiarised”, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing to be influenced by the work of others. The key is to ensure that you’re consciously agreeing with a design, rather than just aping (mimicking unthinkingly - a definition which no doubt does our hairy cousins a grave disservice). Sadly, much of the technology sector simply apes.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/28/copycats/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
