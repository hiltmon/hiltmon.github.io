</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
TimeToCall is a simple, universal iOS application I developed to help people choose the best time to call when calling internationally. This is part 10, the last part in a series of posts about the thinking and work done. My goal is to share just how much effort it really does take to craft an iOS app and ship it. I hope this series helps you to understand why it costs so much and takes so long to create beautiful software.

</h1>
<p class=summary-body>
We all know the old English proverb, â€œClothes don&rsquo;t make the man", declaring that we should not judge a person by their appearance.
Yet we do continue to judge people, just these days it&rsquo;s by their devices.
That person is a Apple fanboy with their walled garden white earbud iPhone and shiny MacBook Air. That person is an open-source neck-beard with their incomprehensible 1976 vintage text editor running on a cheap ChromeBook.
