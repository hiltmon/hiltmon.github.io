I bought it based on a single viewing of another PowerBook because it ran UNIX with a GUI. Oh and it was thin and fast and beautiful.
It surely is the best device I ever owned.
I had been a Mac user in the early 1990&rsquo;s, but, like most, I moved over to Windows for work.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/31/1ghz-titanium-powerbook/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 28, 2012 1:28 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/28/mind-hacks/>Mind hacks</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A lot of people, including myself, talk a lot about organization, productivity and life hacks that make things run better for us, and share it with others. But on a more personal note, some of us also need additional hacks just to function normally in normal situations.
I call these mind-hacks, tricks that enable people like me to function and get through the day. Without them, our minds just spin off in a hundred directions and we get nothing done.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/28/mind-hacks/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 26, 2012 4:59 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/26/be-organized-and-productive/>Be Organized and Productive</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The theme of 2012 was all about getting organized and productive using software. I may have spent 2012 developing Kifu and some internal applications for clients, but I spent a lot of time this year getting better organized and more productive on my Mac. It’s ridiculous how much this has paid off.
So, instead of a cool-products-of-2012-year-in-review post, here are many of the things I do and tools I use to be organized and productive, with thanks to those to shared the ideas with us.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/26/be-organized-and-productive/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 26, 2012 1:47 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/26/2012-year-end-ipad-essentials/>2012 Year End iPad Essentials</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I posted my 2012 iPad Essentials (excluding games) in March this year when the iPad 3 came out. Since then, the iPad 4 and the iPad mini have launched. Surprisingly enough, the early 2012 essentials (excluding games) have changed very little:

But if you are already in a Terminal session, you need to leave the keyboard, mouse to Finder and drag and drop the path back. Here’s a trick that gets you to the frontmost Finder path without leaving the Terminal or keyboard.

There are many wrong ways to do this, and I have seen all of them in practice:
Duplicate the existing class, rename it and add the flexibility to the new class. This sounds great as existing code remains unaffected, but sucks if a bug is found in the original and both need to be maintained.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/19/how-to-flexify-a-class/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 19, 2012 1:09 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/19/instagram-ad-image/>Free Instagram Ad Image for Advertisers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Dear Instagram,

Six months ago, it was Twitter, and six months before that it was Facebook. Quitting over privacy.
Except they didn’t quit. They are all still on Twitter and Facebook and will remain on Instagram, because we, their friends are still there and the service remains awesomely useful.
If you are worried about privacy, but wish to remain on these services, just depersonalize.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/18/depersonalize-because-you-cant-quit/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 17, 2012 4:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/17/youre-the-advertisement/>You’re the Advertisement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It used to be said that:
If you pay for a product, you’re a customer. If you don’t, you’re the product.
Now its getting worse. The new Instagram Terms of Use make you the advertisement for any unknown third party product. Anyone can pay Instagram to use your user name, your image, and your photos to advertise their product to anyone else, without your knowledge or consent.
