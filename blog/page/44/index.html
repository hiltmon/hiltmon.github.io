All posts start as ideas and notes jotted down in nvAlt, Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s fork of Notational Velocity. I like this product because the search and use of notes is fully integrated, and it supports markdown. I have set it up so that all notes are stored as markdown files in a Dropbox folder and Byword has been set up as the external editor.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/15/my-blog-writing-workflow/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 14, 2012 7:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/14/get-to-read-quicker/>Get to read quicker</a></h1><p class=summary-body>People come to hiltmon.com to read, and occasionally to comment on the writing found here.

The average page loads in 2.53 seconds and makes 84 requests. Thats a long time for readers to wait, and a lot of requests. So I decided to check out what is going on.

Why? Longevity and Productivity. I choose the range to suit my needs and skill levels. And the long-term benefits of productivity and time savings way exceed the short-term incremental cost.
All my devices last forever because I purchased the top-of-the-line within the range I needed. In 1998, I purchased the best Dell Inspiron laptop, it lasted until 2003 when I moved to the best Titanium PowerBook, which lasted until 2009 when I acquired my current MacBook Pro.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/top-of-the-line/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 9, 2012 11:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/writing-on-the-ipad/>Writing on the iPad</a></h1><p class=summary-body>This comment by JohnDoey (reproduced in full without permission) on the Asymco article The new feeds and speeds: iPad vs. MacBook Air and iMac sums up the iPad writing experience beautifully (although I think the iPad is a good production system too):
I&rsquo;m a writer also. You missed a key point about writing on iPad.
Writers who are using iPads are not using them like Macs (or Mac clones,) they are using them like typewriters.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/writing-on-the-ipad/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 9, 2012 9:44 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/ipad-on-two-years-of-use/>iPad - On Two Years of Use</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Can you believe it, the iPad has been around only two years, two! Yet it feels like there was never a time before we had them.
I was one of those who pre-ordered the original iPad on launch (and the iPad 2 on its launch). I also wrote three blog posts back then, and it seems my usage patterns have not changed that much:

.markdown
That is all. No others.
Make it so!
Update: It seems the GitHub .md extension is becoming canonical for those who prefer shorter file names. And Dr Drang @drdrang uses it. Who am I to argue. But I&rsquo;ll be sticking with .markdown.
I suppose I&rsquo;d better say why:
We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/07/the-markdown-file-extension/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 5, 2012 8:57 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/05/you-are-not-ruthless-enough/>You Are Not Ruthless Enough</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Chris Parker writing in You Are Not Ruthless Enough on being ruthless instead of lax when crafting software:
Being ruthless to yourself is having the discipline to become a better developer - not letting yourself get away with the easy or convenient. Being ruthless to your objects is having the discipline to write the API which separates their responsibilities effectively. The combination is what enables you to produce consistent results - to keep shipping, to keep creating great software, and to keep improving.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/05/you-are-not-ruthless-enough/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.social/@hiltmon>Mastodon</a> &#183;
