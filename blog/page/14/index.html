In the past I used a commercial ODBC driver. But ODBC on OS X was deprecated ages ago.
In this post, I&rsquo;ll talk about my current stack for accessing SQL Server databases via Ruby and Python and how to set it up.

I could reach out and touch my family and whomever wandered into the house.
As a teenager, I got a bicycle, and my horizon was the neighborhoods within cycling range. I could reach out and touch my friends in nearby neighborhoods. And I felt less constrained.
Later, I learned to drive, and my horizon grew to the city I was living in.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/06/horizons/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 1, 2013 8:51 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/01/sharing-reminder-lists/>Sharing Reminder Lists</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Looking for a quick and easy way to share reminders with other people? Here&rsquo;s how we do it.
My wife and I share a Reminders.app list called Groceries that we check on the way home. If there is anything on the list, we pop into the shop and pick it up.
Reminders.app is an Apple app included in iOS and the Mac that enables you to create lists, set reminder dates or reminder locations.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/01/sharing-reminder-lists/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 30, 2013 4:59 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/30/google-analytics-for-status-board-server-edition/>Google Analytics for Status Board Server Edition</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Google has finally deprecated their GAPI interface which this used to talk to Google Analytics, sorry folks, it will no longer work.

I often create point form lists of things, whether planning a post or a coding sprint or a client activity. And to keep track of which points in the list are done and which will not be done, or what is right and what is wrong, I like to use ✓ and ✗ symbols.
I use them so frequently and am so lazy that even typing ,,tick and ,,cross TextExpander expansions are too much effort.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/28/sanity-saver-ticks-and-crosses/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 28, 2013 12:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/28/my-mac-indie-writing-workflow/>My Mac Indie Writing Workflow</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few years, I have been writing more and more on my Mac, whether it be single blog posts, blog series, systems documentation, knowledge bases and other articles. The best part is that all the tools I use are indie developed from all over the world, are amazingly great and way better than their mainstream counterparts.
In this post, I want to share the tools I use to write and why I choose them.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/28/my-mac-indie-writing-workflow/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 23, 2013 8:47 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/23/letterhead-markdown-style/>Letterhead - Markdown Style</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So I get this request yesterday to send a document on letterhead. You all may remember letterheads from back in the day when companies had professional printers print their fancy logos on fancy paper that you then ran through the &ldquo;good&rdquo; laser printer that then went into matching fancy envelopes and someone stuck stamps on and mailed them.
I thought that letterheads went the way of the dodo about the same time fax machines and US Mail both died out.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/23/letterhead-markdown-style/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 20, 2013 6:45 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/20/the-one-person-product/>The One-Person Product</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment, writing about David Karp, founder of Tumblr, in The One-Person Product. Not only is this piece well written, it is an amazing perspective of Tumblr from the inside. But, for me, the salient point and the highest praise in the piece goes to David Karp, the founder and visionary:
David has an impeccable sense of what’s best for Tumblr, and he doesn’t need anyone else telling him what’s best for the product.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/20/the-one-person-product/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 16, 2013 6:15 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/16/is-it-time-to-change-tools/>Is it time to change tools?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.
Winston Churchill
Every once in a while I wonder if my programming tools, languages and platforms need to be changed. Maybe, just maybe, the software mix I use every day needs to be shaken up.
And then my mind starts spinning in circles.
As we all do, I find myself using the same languages and tools over and over again.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/16/is-it-time-to-change-tools/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
