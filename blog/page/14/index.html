In today&rsquo;s post, I&rsquo;ll write more about how I use it.
By the way, I have previously written about spike solutions, wherein I create solutions for the bigger technical problems at the start of a project to be sure they are achievable. This is different.
In this case, being back in C++ and rusty as an old door hinge, I also needed to create and test out snippets of code I could be using without having to make and run the entire product.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/using-the-spike-folder/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 4, 2013 3:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/rip-doug-engelbart/>RIP Doug Engelbart</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Doug Engelbart passed away last night at age 88. I remember him as one of the names behind the beginnings of modern computers, inventing the mouse, hypertext, video conferencing and collaboration. But these were not the ends of his contributions, these were the means by which he tried to achieve his intent, to augment human intellect.
Too bad we use his inventions for Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, LOLCats and flame wars; we degrade human intellect.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/rip-doug-engelbart/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 3, 2013 10:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/>A Simple C++ Project Structure</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the things I need in my new job is a bunch of blazingly fast daemons to capture market information and trade data.

So I went old-school. Retro even. Plain old C++. My favorite programmer&rsquo;s editor.

We need to keep pushing forward without them, and do what we’ve always done before: route around the obstructions and maintain what’s great about the web. Keep building and supporting new tools, technologies, and platforms to empower independence, interoperability, and web property ownership.
The context is how the big internet companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have locked down the open internet, and that we need to overcome their new barriers and keep building so that we can keep the great internet we know and love.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/keep-building/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 25, 2013 10:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/25/back-in-the-saddle/>Back in the Saddle</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TL;DR: I got a job! Gonna keep writing though.
As of this week, I&rsquo;m back in the saddle in the finance industry, designing and developing leading edge platforms and systems for a new asset manager, my favorite kind of business. The challenges in the new firm are new to me and epic. And I love a good challenge.
How does this affect&mldr;

Pinboard is a paid for bookmarking site that focuses on speed, utility and longevity (and anti-socialness!). Pinbrowser is an iPhone and iPad application to access your Pinboard, other&rsquo;s bookmarks (making it more social) and the all famous popular bookmarks list.
It&rsquo;s the social aspect that attracted me to the product in the first place.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/19/pinbrowser-updated/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 15, 2013 12:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/15/wwdc-2013-post-game-review/>WWDC 2013 Post-Game Review</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Just under a week ago, Tim Cook walked out on stage to present the keynote at WWDC 2013 (<a href=http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2013/>Video here</a>).

As a teenager, I got a bicycle, and my horizon was the neighborhoods within cycling range. I could reach out and touch my friends in nearby neighborhoods. And I felt less constrained.
Later, I learned to drive, and my horizon grew to the city I was living in.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/06/horizons/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 1, 2013 8:51 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/01/sharing-reminder-lists/>Sharing Reminder Lists</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Looking for a quick and easy way to share reminders with other people?

My wife and I share a Reminders.app list called Groceries that we check on the way home. If there is anything on the list, we pop into the shop and pick it up.
Reminders.app is an Apple app included in iOS and the Mac that enables you to create lists, set reminder dates or reminder locations.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/01/sharing-reminder-lists/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
