They may never see this, but, in no particular order, a huge thank you from me to you all.

I hear this every day. Even now, in 2013, more than 20 years after hierarchical file systems became the core and the norm of computing, users still struggle to understand something as simple as knowing the location of their own files in their own computer systems.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/24/cannot-find-file/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 7, 2013 1:50 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/07/managing-multiple-projects-assembly-notes-in-one/>Managing Multiple Project's Assembly Notes in One</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The problem I have is that I regularly need to open a specific set of Markdown documents scattered all over my file system while I work and have them available at my fingertips.

I&rsquo;ve been speaking with users of other awesome programmer&rsquo;s editors and they wanted to know what it is in TextMate that I love so much and keeps me using it.
So here are the basic parts of TextMate 2 that I use regularly. Maybe you can divine some tips from it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/11/09/textmate-2-basics/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 3, 2013 5:51 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/11/03/merge-asana-projects-into-omnifocus/>Merge Asana Projects into OmniFocus</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Note: Updated the script, see Merge Asana Projects Into OmniFocus Updated.
I use OmniFocus to manage my personal tasks and activities, but my company uses Asana to manage Project tasks and activities amongst the team. I am so used to using OmniFocus that I often forget to check or update Asana, and thus miss tasks assigned to me or progress by the team.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the projects and tasks in Asana also appeared in OmniFocus?</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/11/03/merge-asana-projects-into-omnifocus/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 23, 2013 9:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/10/23/apples-and-rotten-oranges/>Apples and Rotten Oranges</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So Frank Shaw, Corporate Vice President of Communications at Microsoft wrote a thing called Apples and Oranges in response to the Apple Laptop, iPad, iWork, iLife and Mac Pro event yesterday, and sadly, it got a lot of coverage.
So I put my snark hat on and decided to throw darts at his piece (almost completely reproduced here).

Using canonical Rails, that means a single, massive rails app with a bunch of controllers, a heap of views and a complex security model.
I prefer small, focussed apps, so I decided to share the model instead. Here&rsquo;s how it works.

The .doc file format was also obfuscated, deliberately or intentionally: rather than a parseable document containing formatting and macro metadata, it was effectively a dump of the in-memory data structures used by word, with pointers to the subroutines that provided formatting or macro support.
He focuses on the usability issues, the compatibility issues, the inconstancies and the forced need to upgrade just to read other people&rsquo;s documents - and the idiocy of using this incomprehensible, short lived format in publishing.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/10/13/why-microsoft-word-must-die/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
