I’ve been planning on doing this for ages, but no excuses, you should too.
And then this happened. Last week, Mat Honan got hacked hard (see Yes, I was hacked. Hard.). Someone gained access to his Apple ID, reset his other accounts and nuked all his computers.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/06/mischief-managed-google-2-factor-authentication/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 6, 2012 11:33 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/06/mischief-managed-clean-inbox/>Mischief Managed: Clean Inbox</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Mischief Managed is a series of posts on tasks and technologies I use to maintain my computing environment.

My Inbox has gotten out of control, several thousand emails reside in the combined inbox in Mail.app and I have not filed or archived any for weeks.
The last time I cleaned it up, it took me hours because I had to drag and drop each email into the right folder, and half the time I had to scroll to find the right folder.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/06/mischief-managed-clean-inbox/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 5, 2012 3:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/05/new-site-font/>New Site Font</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I love Octopress, but I have never been happy with the default fonts. The default PT Sans and PT Serif fonts are very, very nice, but not awesome. I did like the X and Y height, the clarity, the ease of reading, but the letterspacing on the serif font was too tight and it started to look jaggy.
This week, Adobe released Source Sans Pro, their first free and open font, and I think it’s great for a technical blog-style web site.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/05/new-site-font/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 3, 2012 3:38 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/03/change-is-good-new-applications-replacing-old-ones/>Change is Good - New Applications replacing Old Ones</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There is some amazing independent software out there for the Mac. And I use a lot of it. I realized today, while fixing a problem on my wife’s laptop, that I have pretty much replaced many older products with new ones on my computer over the last year or so, yet she still uses all the old stuff.
Change is good for me. I love using new products that improve my productivity, work better or look better.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/03/change-is-good-new-applications-replacing-old-ones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 3, 2012 1:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/03/moom-corners/>Moom Corners</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Another quick trick, this time for Moom. When doing Ruby on Rails programming, I like my terminal at the bottom-right of the screen, my text editor at the bottom-left, the browser top-right and BBEdit (for taking notes) at the top-left. When blogging, I like the terminal in the same place, but I want Byword at the top-left. I got tired of dragging windows everywhere, so I set up keyboard shortcuts usimg Moom to place windows in the corners.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/03/moom-corners/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 3, 2012 11:50 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/03/setting-up-bbedit-for-markdown/>Setting up BBEdit for Markdown</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Two advanced settings are needed to make BBEdit treat all new documents as Markdown format, and to save with the correct file extension. They are:
defaults write com.barebones.bbedit PreferredFilenameExtension_Markdown -string "markdown" defaults write com.barebones.bbedit DefaultLanguageNameForNewDocuments Markdown If you use TextWrangler, replace the “bbedit” in the above with “textwrangler”.

Amongst the best new features are photo’s, location checkins using Foursquare and weather. They have also updated the markdown engine.

Since this new version is sandboxed, the command line client has been moved.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/02/day-one-updated-to-v1-dot-7/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 1, 2012 2:24 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/01/my-first-computer-sinclair-zx81/>My first computer - Sinclair ZX81</a></h1><p class=summary-body>With the Commodore 64 turning 30 today (See: BBC News - Commodore 64 turns 30: What do today&rsquo;s kids make of it?), I started thinking about my first computer, the Sinclair ZX81 (see it on Wikipedia), also called the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the USA.

They then bring out a litany of reasons which boil down to two: the current systems cannot do it and current processes cannot support it. Therefore, management cannot make the change. And if management cannot make the changes, may the business cannot compete, cannot be successful and cannot continue.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/01/hiltmonism-lead-the-business/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 30, 2012 1:04 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/30/if-the-nbc-olympics-team-did-the-nfl/>If the NBC Olympics team did the NFL</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The current NBC Olympics coverage is the absolute worst thing to ever happen to TV, sports and the Olympics. Talk about #NBCFail, here’s it is in context if the NBC Olympics team were responsible for NFL broadcasts:
You would only see games played by one chosen team Only people with cable subscriptions could watch the chosen game of the week Only people with cable subscriptions could watch the selected game on the internet Only people with cable subscriptions could read about the game in the newspaper NBC will ensure other broadcasters do show any clips of any games on their channels or on the internet at any time Expats outside the USA will be unable to watch any NFL, ever They would only show the plays by this chosen team where they score points, to protect the audience from watching the boring bits of the game (like the actual game itself) One exception to the scoring play rule: if another team does something completely stupid or embarrassing, they&rsquo;ll show that too, but only a short clip, and repeat it many times The one game shown would be tape delayed until Thursday night to prepare the audience for the upcoming weekend&rsquo;s games (which they cannot watch) While the other team has offense, or the chosen team is not scoring, they will show hours of sad, sobby backstories about chosen team&rsquo;s players tough upbringings They would never show any injuries to protect the feelings of the audience They would never show any umpire decisions to protect the feelings of the audience They would never show any cheerleaders to protect the feelings of the audience They would never show any team changeovers to protect the feelings of the audience When people complain on twitter, they will &ldquo;embrace the feedback&rdquo;, and ignore it (oh wait, this is the third olympics I&rsquo;ve seen and they&rsquo;re still ignoring the complaints) They will interrupt the stream of advertising only for a few moments every hour to show the scoring play, backstory or softball interview with an old player from the chosen team The commentators will, of course, have never watched an NFL game before, being chosen for the whiteness of their teeth or largeness of their, er, eyes.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/30/if-the-nbc-olympics-team-did-the-nfl/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
