But one thing does not work, Code Sense. Xcode does not provide code completion or jump to definition for these projects.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could enable this too.
The solution is simple, you need to use the Xcode build system to create the indices that the IDE uses.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/07/xcode-4-code-completion-for-external-build-projects/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 7, 2013 11:02 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/07/good-tools-change/>Good Tools Change</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In Good Tools, James Bennett writes a compelling article on how his investment in learning his most used tool, emacs, has paid huge dividends in his productivity for years and years.

Good tools, for programmers, are investments: you give them your time and your brain up-front, and then they pay dividends for years on end.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/07/good-tools-change/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 5, 2013 11:31 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/05/xcode-and-the-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/>Xcode and the Simple C++ Project Structure</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In a previous post, I talked about a A Simple C++ Project Structure that I am using to create a bunch of high-speed daemons for work.
It&rsquo;s been fun using TextMate 2 and a Terminal to make and run the project, but now that I am getting to the meat of the coding, I&rsquo;d prefer to use an IDE to help me navigate and debug the code.
Here&rsquo;s how to set up Xcode 4 on the Mac to compile using our Makefile and run/debug the application.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/05/xcode-and-the-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 4, 2013 5:48 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/using-the-spike-folder/>Using the Spike Folder</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In yesterday&rsquo;s post A Simple C++ Project Structure, I mentioned the spike folder. In today&rsquo;s post, I&rsquo;ll write more about how I use it.
By the way, I have previously written about spike solutions, wherein I create solutions for the bigger technical problems at the start of a project to be sure they are achievable. This is different.
In this case, being back in C++ and rusty as an old door hinge, I also needed to create and test out snippets of code I could be using without having to make and run the entire product.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/using-the-spike-folder/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 4, 2013 3:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/rip-doug-engelbart/>RIP Doug Engelbart</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Doug Engelbart passed away last night at age 88. I remember him as one of the names behind the beginnings of modern computers, inventing the mouse, hypertext, video conferencing and collaboration. But these were not the ends of his contributions, these were the means by which he tried to achieve his intent, to augment human intellect.
Too bad we use his inventions for Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, LOLCats and flame wars; we degrade human intellect.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/04/rip-doug-engelbart/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 3, 2013 10:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/>A Simple C++ Project Structure</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the things I need in my new job is a bunch of blazingly fast daemons to capture market information and trade data. I prototyped them in Ruby to see what comes down the line, but I have the need, the need for speed. Which means I need a UNIX C or C++ framework.
So I went old-school. Retro even. Plain old C++. My favorite programmer&rsquo;s editor. And the good old terminal, er, iTerm 2, just Mac-like.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 3, 2013 8:18 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/keep-building/>Keep Building</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment (@marco) on his blog in Lockdown, writes:
We need to keep pushing forward without them, and do what we’ve always done before: route around the obstructions and maintain what’s great about the web. Keep building and supporting new tools, technologies, and platforms to empower independence, interoperability, and web property ownership.
The context is how the big internet companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have locked down the open internet, and that we need to overcome their new barriers and keep building so that we can keep the great internet we know and love.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/keep-building/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 25, 2013 10:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/25/back-in-the-saddle/>Back in the Saddle</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TL;DR: I got a job!
