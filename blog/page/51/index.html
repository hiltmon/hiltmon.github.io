His conclusion is obviously no, locked cockpit doors and aware passengers are the only things that work. Even the $1.2b worth of scanners and another $1.2b in air marshals are totally useless.

The Internet is probably the most important technological advancement of my lifetime. Its strength lies in its open architecture and its ability to allow a framework where all voices can be heard. Like the printing press before it (which states also tried to regulate, for centuries), it democratizes information, and thus it democratizes power.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/21/adam-savage-on-sopa/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 19, 2011 11:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/19/the-missing-feature/>The missing feature</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>My new product seems to be missing a key feature.

Acorn I have, but use Photoshop, Illustrator and Pixelmator a lot more BBedit is open all the time, but I use TextMate for programming (already switched to TextMate 2 Alpha) Appviz instead of Appfigures The great Kaleidoscope for file compares instead of Changes Tossing up between Coda (my old favorite) and Espresso 2 (because I think the old CSSEdit was the best) Skitch for snapping instead of LittleSnapper (use only for storing well designed web pages, though thinking of going back now that Evernote owns Skitch) Fantastical instead of Today New to me:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/19/developer-and-power-tools/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 17, 2011 12:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/17/hiltmonism-if-it-aint-broke/>Hiltmonism - If it ain't broke, break it</a></h1><p class=summary-body>You have all heard the phrase &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;.

Unacceptable!
If this were the case, we&rsquo;d still be using stone axes and living in caves, as we did for 98% of the past 100,000 years. The reason we have metal axes and houses, electricity and cars and computers and internet is because there were people out there who felt it was broke, and they found new and interesting ways to fix it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/17/hiltmonism-if-it-aint-broke/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 17, 2011 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/17/bring-in-the-nerds/>Bring in the nerds</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Joshua Kopstein, writing in Dear Congress, It&rsquo;s No Longer OK To Not Know How The Internet Works, getting angry with Congress on the SOPA hearings:
It’d be one thing if legitimate technical questions directed at the bill’s supporters weren’t met with either silence or veiled accusations that the other side was sympathetic to piracy.

Talent is the natural ability to do something for which people may think there’s not much effort put into accomplishing something and that’s simply a result of people not always being previewed to what you go through to do what you do.
I&rsquo;m a very good software designer. Proof? I have a long track record of excellent software. Those who know me and my work invariably describe me as talented.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/16/on-the-topic-of-talent/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 16, 2011 8:36 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/16/speculative-work-hurts/>Speculative work hurts</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sebastiaan de With, a really great designer, posts on Facebook of all places on how speculative work hurts the design industry at large.
Happens in software too, where clients expect you to plan, document and design the software before entering into a contract.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/16/speculative-work-hurts/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 16, 2011 8:32 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/16/machine-driven/>Machine-driven</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Via Buzz Andersen,

Focus on value creation. Design enhances value, it does not create it. Stop creating shitty startups that look amazing.
He&rsquo;s not saying that you should dump design and designers (phew!), just that he is sick of over-designed new startups that provide no real value.

Think hard about what problem you can solve that a customer will give you $10 for and work your ass off at delivering that $10 of value as fast and as cheaply as possible.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/16/design-is-horseshit/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
