The anti-piracy enforcement arm of the RIAA has, for almost a decade, been so aggressive about investigating, suing and attempting to prosecute those it accused of illegally downloading movies or music that it was sued by illegal investigatory practices and invasion of privacy, for fraud, conspiracy and extortion, deceptive business practices and violation of the RICO statutes normally used to prosecute bosses of organized crime families.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/23/the-cartoon-villain-behind-sopa/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 23, 2011 10:52 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/23/hiltmonism-one-version-of-the-truth/>One version of the truth</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Its not uncommon for different software systems in a company to contain the same kinds information as others. However, it is very uncommon for this information to be the same across all systems. Often the accounting system has different information than the trading system, for example. Inventory systems often have different stock levels than sales systems.
The impact of this is that traders trade on what they know, accountants report profit on what they know, and sales happens on what they know.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/23/hiltmonism-one-version-of-the-truth/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 21, 2011 5:54 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/21/smoke-screening/>Smoke Screening</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Charles C Mann writing on Smoke Screening in Vanity Fair, spends an afternoon at the airport with Bruce Schneier looking at the TSA in action and asks whether any of it actually makes is safer?

The Internet is probably the most important technological advancement of my lifetime. Its strength lies in its open architecture and its ability to allow a framework where all voices can be heard. Like the printing press before it (which states also tried to regulate, for centuries), it democratizes information, and thus it democratizes power.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/21/adam-savage-on-sopa/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 19, 2011 11:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/19/the-missing-feature/>The missing feature</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>My new product seems to be missing a key feature.

Acorn I have, but use Photoshop, Illustrator and Pixelmator a lot more BBedit is open all the time, but I use TextMate for programming (already switched to TextMate 2 Alpha) Appviz instead of Appfigures The great Kaleidoscope for file compares instead of Changes Tossing up between Coda (my old favorite) and Espresso 2 (because I think the old CSSEdit was the best) Skitch for snapping instead of LittleSnapper (use only for storing well designed web pages, though thinking of going back now that Evernote owns Skitch) Fantastical instead of Today New to me:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/19/developer-and-power-tools/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 17, 2011 12:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/17/hiltmonism-if-it-aint-broke/>If it ain't broke, break it</a></h1><p class=summary-body>You have all heard the phrase &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;.

Unacceptable!
If this were the case, we&rsquo;d still be using stone axes and living in caves, as we did for 98% of the past 100,000 years. The reason we have metal axes and houses, electricity and cars and computers and internet is because there were people out there who felt it was broke, and they found new and interesting ways to fix it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/17/hiltmonism-if-it-aint-broke/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 17, 2011 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/17/bring-in-the-nerds/>Bring in the nerds</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Joshua Kopstein, writing in Dear Congress, It&rsquo;s No Longer OK To Not Know How The Internet Works, getting angry with Congress on the SOPA hearings:
It’d be one thing if legitimate technical questions directed at the bill’s supporters weren’t met with either silence or veiled accusations that the other side was sympathetic to piracy.
