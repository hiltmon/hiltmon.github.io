A 32GB Microsoft Surface RT has only 16GB free according to the Microsoft Surface FAQ. Thats 16GB for the Operating System! 5GB of that is recovery tools which could be on the net, but instead chews up expensive internal flash memory! This bloat explains the pricing and performance issues with the device. Arguably, you can expand the Surface (and Android devices) with up to 64GB more disk space using a single SD card, but that I/O is pretty slow compared to the built-in flash memory.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/surface-disk-free-space/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 5, 2012 1:26 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/>AAPL vs AMZN Performance Madness</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Philip Elmer-DeWitt noted something interesting on Saturday in Fortune magazine, Amazon&rsquo;s price-to-earnings ratio is now 2,767. Apple&rsquo;s is 13! In the last quarter, Apple&rsquo;s earnings were up and the stock went down, whereas Amazon reported a loss and the stock went up.
When a company reports bumper earnings, I assume its stock price should rise, and when a company takes a loss, the stock price should fall. After all, the stock price is really the public valuation of the company.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 29, 2012 3:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/29/grand-central-today/>Grand Central Today</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Images courtesy MTAInfo.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/29/grand-central-today/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 27, 2012 4:45 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/>Surface RT is not a Duck</a></h1><p class=summary-body>What is a duck? Well, if it looks like a duck, floats like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. The just-released Microsoft Surface RT fails the duck test, it looks like a tablet, but it is not a tablet. Windows 8 RT also fails the duck test, it looks like Windows 8, but it is not Windows 8.
For the record, I have used the real proper Windows 8 on a Samsung tablet before, so my impressions of the Surface and Windows RT are based on that experience.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 27, 2012 11:39 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/>Marco and the Surface</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment, of Instapaper and The Magazine fame, went to a Microsoft Store yesterday to try out the new Surface and wrote about the experience in his blog in An alternate universe. Go read it. I’ll wait.
I’m sad to say but I think I may have to agree with his conclusion:
But it’s not for me at all. Not even for testing, experimenting, or curiosity. It feels too much like using a Windows PC, which was exactly Microsoft’s intention, and it will appeal to people who want that.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 25, 2012 2:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/>Windows 8 Launch MIA</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So I sat back today to watch the live stream of the Microsoft Windows 8 launch. I was excited, this is the first Windows launch that interested me since Windows 95. And I waited for them to show me the product, its features and its pricing. And I waited, and waited, and then the show ended. Information about Windows 8 was missing in action at the launch.
Now I know that the press has had it for ages.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 25, 2012 12:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/>Apple vs Microsoft Launch Differences</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I started a post on the Windows 8 Launch which I will get back to later, because there were some very key differences between the two presentations and they really resounded with me. Some of them stylistic, some fundamental, you choose which.
Microsoft: “will”, Apple: “is”. A lot of the Microsoft presentation was all about “will”, you will be more productive, you will have more device choices, you will enjoy, you will do X better.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 24, 2012 3:38 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/>Email Etiquette</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I don’t know about you, but I get a lot of emails across a lot of accounts and the time and effort to process my inbox is growing exponentially. I just wish that senders and responders on email would follow some basic etiquette rules that will make our use of email both more pleasant and more productive.</p><p>Email is a form of communication which is a reflection of you. Bad email etiquette reflects badly on you, and a record of this is kept in mailboxes over which you have no control. Good email etiquette reflects well on you, improves your public perception and persona and increases the chance of a prompt and comprehensive response. It’s not hard to maintain good email etiquette once you know what it is.</p><p>One thing before we start, before creating or responding to an email, ask yourself this: is email the right medium for this communication? If you are not sure, pick up the phone or wander over to the person and have a conversation. Email only if it is the right medium.</p><p>And always follow good etiquette. This article contains a comprehensive list of rules and recommendations learned through experience and research.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 24, 2012 9:51 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/>The Big 5 Windows 8 Lineups</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My thoughts on announced hardware for Windows 8 being released this week.
Asus Asus will be launching their Zenbooks with touch screens for Windows 8 in November, or really replacing the screens on their old Zenbooks with touch screens and selling them as new models.
They are updating their modular tablet to run Windows RT and calling it the Vivo Tab RT. 10.1” with a dock for the low price of $599.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 23, 2012 8:15 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/23/thered-be-something-called-a-mini/>There’d be something called a mini</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My thoughts on today’s announcements by Apple.
13” Retina Macbook Pro The 13” Retina Macbook Pro looks good, is priced high as expected, and is probably going to sell very very well. But the 8GB RAM limit and the lack of an external graphics card to drive the Retina display is puzzling. The 15” has an external NVIDIA GT 650M and can go up to 16GB RAM, that makes it a pro machine.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/23/thered-be-something-called-a-mini/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
