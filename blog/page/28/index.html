There, I said it. And it&rsquo;s true. There are electronic cobwebs on my copy. You may now run out of the room screaming.
For many, this is like saying I rarely bathe. I rarely use Microsoft Office because I have absolutely no reason to use it except for two specific cases.
Email, not Outlook There are several reasons why I don&rsquo;t use Outlook for email:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/07/rarely-microsoft-office/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 6, 2012 3:32 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/06/managing-the-productivity-context/>Managing the Productivity Context</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Productivity is doing less stuff to get more stuff done. Managing its context is the key to becoming more productive. Here is a framework to establish and manage your productivity context to maximize your productivity when using your computer, based on what I have been doing to manage my own on my Mac.

I needed to reduce the number of inboxes first.
Those of us who have been on the Internet for decades have amassed a large number of email addresses on a variety of services. As time passed, and new services emerged, we added more. Most of us are loathe to close any of these addresses down just in case we get an email there.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/06/reducing-inboxes/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 5, 2012 3:56 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/surface-disk-free-space/>Surface Disk Free Space</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Yikes! A 32GB Microsoft Surface RT has only 16GB free according to the Microsoft Surface FAQ. Thats 16GB for the Operating System! 5GB of that is recovery tools which could be on the net, but instead chews up expensive internal flash memory! This bloat explains the pricing and performance issues with the device. Arguably, you can expand the Surface (and Android devices) with up to 64GB more disk space using a single SD card, but that I/O is pretty slow compared to the built-in flash memory.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/surface-disk-free-space/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 5, 2012 1:26 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/>AAPL vs AMZN Performance Madness</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Philip Elmer-DeWitt noted something interesting on Saturday in Fortune magazine, Amazon&rsquo;s price-to-earnings ratio is now 2,767. Apple&rsquo;s is 13! In the last quarter, Apple&rsquo;s earnings were up and the stock went down, whereas Amazon reported a loss and the stock went up.
When a company reports bumper earnings, I assume its stock price should rise, and when a company takes a loss, the stock price should fall. After all, the stock price is really the public valuation of the company.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 29, 2012 3:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/29/grand-central-today/>Grand Central Today</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Images courtesy MTAInfo.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 27, 2012 4:45 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/>Surface RT is not a Duck</a></h1><p class=summary-body>What is a duck? Well, if it looks like a duck, floats like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. The just-released Microsoft Surface RT fails the duck test, it looks like a tablet, but it is not a tablet. Windows 8 RT also fails the duck test, it looks like Windows 8, but it is not Windows 8.
For the record, I have used the real proper Windows 8 on a Samsung tablet before, so my impressions of the Surface and Windows RT are based on that experience.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 27, 2012 11:39 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/>Marco and the Surface</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment, of Instapaper and The Magazine fame, went to a Microsoft Store yesterday to try out the new Surface and wrote about the experience in his blog in An alternate universe. Go read it. I’ll wait.
I’m sad to say but I think I may have to agree with his conclusion:
But it’s not for me at all. Not even for testing, experimenting, or curiosity. It feels too much like using a Windows PC, which was exactly Microsoft’s intention, and it will appeal to people who want that.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 25, 2012 2:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/>Windows 8 Launch MIA</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So I sat back today to watch the live stream of the Microsoft Windows 8 launch. I was excited, this is the first Windows launch that interested me since Windows 95. And I waited for them to show me the product, its features and its pricing. And I waited, and waited, and then the show ended. Information about Windows 8 was missing in action at the launch.
Now I know that the press has had it for ages.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 25, 2012 12:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/>Apple vs Microsoft Launch Differences</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I started a post on the Windows 8 Launch which I will get back to later, because there were some very key differences between the two presentations and they really resounded with me. Some of them stylistic, some fundamental, you choose which.
Microsoft: “will”, Apple: “is”. A lot of the Microsoft presentation was all about “will”, you will be more productive, you will have more device choices, you will enjoy, you will do X better.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
