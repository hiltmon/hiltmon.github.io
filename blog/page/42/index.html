In America we have a motivation problem : money. I&rsquo;m not a communist. I love capitalism (I even love money), but here&rsquo;s a simple fact we&rsquo;ve known since 1962: using money as a motivator makes us less capable at problem-solving. It actually makes us dumber.
Then he goes on to talk about the Candle problem and Functional fixedness, using them to explain how some CEO&rsquo;s who are improperly motivated by money drive their businesses into ruin, something we have all seen in action.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/09/the-candle-problem/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 9, 2012 11:39 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/09/explaining-the-internet-to-old-powerbrokers/>Explaining the Internet to Old Powerbrokers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Ben Hammersley gave a speech to the IAAC and reproduced it online at Check Against Delivery.

In short, he explains the importance of the internet to a bunch of old, pre-internet security politicians.

I get the biggest technical problems solved early, I gain understanding of any pitfalls I may encounter and I can estimate the time and work better. I highly recommend the practice. A few days spent spiking solutions saves weeks and months later.
Get your geek on, were diving in.
A spike solution is a software project to figure out a tough technical or design problem (note: singular).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/06/spike-solutions/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 4, 2012 7:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/04/adjusting-the-cap/>Adjusting the Cap</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Alex Knight, writing in his own blog Zero Distraction in The Disparity between Smartphones And Mobile Carriers sets the scene exactly as I see it:
There’s a massive disparity between data sucking smartphones and data plans offered by carriers. Customers know this, and the carriers are fully cognizant of it. The problem is they make a ton of money from you already, and since you probably don’t have a lot of choice as far as competition is concerned, they can charge whatever they see fit.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/04/adjusting-the-cap/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 1, 2012 12:35 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/01/and-this-is-why/>And this is why</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Life, communication, programming, it&rsquo;s all about structuring a rational argument. But too many people are either unable to, or are unwilling to, rationalize.
&ldquo;I hold this opinion because I&rsquo;ve read the facts and thought it through&rdquo; matters. &ldquo;I hold this opinion, and that&rsquo;s it&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t.
Ian Betteridge
Whether the argument is about creative design, system architecture, which restaurant to eat at or politics and religion, it&rsquo;s critically important to express, clarify and declare the rationalization behind it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/01/and-this-is-why/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:17 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/i-love-debugging/>I love debugging</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Rob Galankis tongue-in-cheek writing in Why I hate Test Driven Development:
&mldr; So why do I hate TDD?
Because debugging is fun. There, I said it. I love debugging. I think lots of clever people like debugging. I love someone having a problem, coming to me, looking at it together, getting up to walk around, look at the ceiling, talk to myself, stand in front of a whiteboard, draw some lines that spark some idea, try it, manually test a fix out, slouch down in my chair staring at my computer lost in thought, and repeating this until I actually find and fix the problem.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/i-love-debugging/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/photoshop-etiquette-for-web-designers/>Photoshop Etiquette for Web Designers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There is a brilliant list of things web designers should be doing when designing web apps in PhotoShop at the photoshop etiquette manifesto for web designers. Do these and we developers will have a much easier time implementing your designs.
Applies to iOS app designers, Mac App designers, in fact any app designers too.
From now on, all my designers will be asked to follow these rules.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/makers-schedule-managers-schedule/>Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Classic article by Paul Graham in 2009 called Maker&rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&rsquo;s Schedule.
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&rsquo;re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.
There are two types of schedule, which I&rsquo;ll call the manager&rsquo;s schedule and the maker&rsquo;s schedule. The manager&rsquo;s schedule is for bosses. It&rsquo;s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/makers-schedule-managers-schedule/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 4:16 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades/>The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brilliant post by Wil Shipley on his blog called The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades, well worth a read:
Right now developers selling through the Mac App Store face a lose/lose choice: either provide all major upgrades to existing customers for free (thus losing a quarter of our revenue), or create a “new” product for each major version (creating customer confusion) and charge existing customers full price again (creating customer anger).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 10:47 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/on-digital-hoarding/>On Digital Hoarding</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Melinda Beck writing in the WSJ in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303404704577305520318265602.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">Drowning in Email, Photos, Files? Hoarding Goes Digital</a> presents a fact-less and ridiculous claim that we are doing something <em>wrong</em> by storing all the emails and files that we do. In the article, she equates the rest of us, people and companies alike, with those crazy nutters who fill their houses with junk.</p><p>My take: We, especially businesses, need to keep all old emails under law in case of subpoena, just like individuals need to store tax records. We need all our old work files as they are referenced in later works. We need our music and photo files because we no longer have their physical equivalents (or have to buy them again and again in case of media). In short, we&rsquo;re not hoarding, we&rsquo;re filing, scrapbooking and holding on to our possessions that are no longer physical.</p><p>But let me respond to the article.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/on-digital-hoarding/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
