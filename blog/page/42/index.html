Do these and we developers will have a much easier time implementing your designs.
Applies to iOS app designers, Mac App designers, in fact any app designers too.
From now on, all my designers will be asked to follow these rules.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/photoshop-etiquette-for-web-designers/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/makers-schedule-managers-schedule/>Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Classic article by Paul Graham in 2009 called Maker&rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&rsquo;s Schedule.
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&rsquo;re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.
There are two types of schedule, which I&rsquo;ll call the manager&rsquo;s schedule and the maker&rsquo;s schedule. The manager&rsquo;s schedule is for bosses. It&rsquo;s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/makers-schedule-managers-schedule/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 4:16 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades/>The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brilliant post by Wil Shipley on his blog called The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades, well worth a read:
Right now developers selling through the Mac App Store face a lose/lose choice: either provide all major upgrades to existing customers for free (thus losing a quarter of our revenue), or create a “new” product for each major version (creating customer confusion) and charge existing customers full price again (creating customer anger).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 10:47 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/on-digital-hoarding/>On Digital Hoarding</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Melinda Beck writing in the WSJ in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303404704577305520318265602.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">Drowning in Email, Photos, Files? Hoarding Goes Digital</a> presents a fact-less and ridiculous claim that we are doing something <em>wrong</em> by storing all the emails and files that we do. In the article, she equates the rest of us, people and companies alike, with those crazy nutters who fill their houses with junk.</p><p>My take: We, especially businesses, need to keep all old emails under law in case of subpoena, just like individuals need to store tax records. We need all our old work files as they are referenced in later works. We need our music and photo files because we no longer have their physical equivalents (or have to buy them again and again in case of media). In short, we&rsquo;re not hoarding, we&rsquo;re filing, scrapbooking and holding on to our possessions that are no longer physical.</p><p>But let me respond to the article.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/on-digital-hoarding/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 10:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/youre-being-stalked/>You're being stalked</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In the same vein as an earlier article on my blog, Giving Yourself Away With a Facebook Login, Alexis Madrigal writing in the atlantic in I&rsquo;m Being Followed: How Google—and 104 Other Companies—Are Tracking Me on the Web quotes Joe Turow saying:

The same can be said for the fictitious 4G on my iPhone 4S.
As a proud Aussie, I am a fan of the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) and Australia&rsquo;s Trade Practices Act that supports them. In short, companies cannot lie or mislead customers in any way, or the ACCC can nail them and force them to make things right.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/ipad-4g-misleading/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 25, 2012 1:26 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/25/freemium-simulation-games-prove-stupidity/>Freemium Simulation Games prove Stupidity</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I don&rsquo;t get the allure and popularity of freemium time-based simulation games like Farmville, DragonVale, Tap Zoo, and Smurfs Village. Yet these games are the top grossing games on the App Store. So I decided to take one on to see if I can find the &lsquo;it&rsquo; factor that makes these games so enjoyable, popular and profitable, without paying real money to short-circuit the game.</p><p><strong>tl;dr (Too Long; Didn&rsquo;t Read)</strong>: You have got to be out of your mind to find these &lsquo;games&rsquo; enjoyable or worth spending money on. They are slow, skill and challenge lacking, chore-based, time-draining, naggy, annoying proofs of stupidity. The only conclusion I can draw from this experience is that people don&rsquo;t value their time, have no self-respect and are just plain stupid to be playing and spending money on these products. &ldquo;Men in Black&rdquo; got it right: &ldquo;A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it&rdquo;.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/25/freemium-simulation-games-prove-stupidity/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 24, 2012 12:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/24/giving-yourself-away-with-a-facebook-login/>Giving yourself away with a Facebook Login</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Applications that require a Facebook login are doing so to gain access to you, your name, your friends, your location, your personal details.

My wife asked me why I deleted Draw Something this week, as we were both enjoying drawing pictures with each other. I told her that Zynga purchased them, who Zynga were and why I did not want them to have access to my information.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/24/giving-yourself-away-with-a-facebook-login/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 22, 2012 3:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/22/clarity/>Clarity</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Jason Fried, on the 37 Signals blog, sums it up in What clarity is all about:
