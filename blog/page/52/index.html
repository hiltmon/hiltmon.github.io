Focus on value creation. Design enhances value, it does not create it. Stop creating shitty startups that look amazing.
He&rsquo;s not saying that you should dump design and designers (phew!), just that he is sick of over-designed new startups that provide no real value.
Money quote:
Think hard about what problem you can solve that a customer will give you $10 for and work your ass off at delivering that $10 of value as fast and as cheaply as possible.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/16/design-is-horseshit/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 14, 2011 12:42 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/14/seek-the-criticism/>Seek the Criticism</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brendan Baker nails it in Fuck the Accolades. Seek the Criticism on Quora. Just read it. It&rsquo;s short.
Two productive things can come out of a meeting with a VC:
They help you directly. Money or connections.
They make you better. They criticize you where it counts. They poke holes. They make you defend. They make you justify. They make you question.
Seek the criticism, because accolades don&rsquo;t help you.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 13, 2011 10:48 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/dont-give-up-on-your-techs/>Don't give up on your techs</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My good friend, Brad Lindenberg, writing in The diminishing value of technical founders in startups talks about the value of the super technical people needed to perform the heavy lifting at the beginning of a startup.
This value of technical people in startups diminishes quicker than you think and entrepreneurs need to be careful not to give away equity to developers who are super valuable in the short term, but end up twiddling their thumbs in the long term.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/dont-give-up-on-your-techs/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 13, 2011 9:10 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/the-usage-lifecycle/>The usage lifecycle</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Joshua Porter writes about the Usage Lifecycle in Designing for the Social Web: The Usage Lifecycle, well worth reading.
The stages in the Usage Lifecycle of a product are:
• Unaware This isn’t so much a stage as it is a starting point. Most people are in this stage: completely unaware of your product.
• Interested These people are interested in your product, but are not yet users. They have lots of questions about how it works and what value it provides.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/the-usage-lifecycle/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 12, 2011 9:28 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/the-lost-art-of-the-print-statement/>The lost art of the print statement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Debugging software is hard, especially if you were not the original author. All programming languages come with debugging tools, from the arcane GDB to the dead sexy step-through debuggers in Xcode and Visual Studio. But, having watched some newbies recently attempt to debug some code using these tools, I noticed something. With all the data in the world on their screens, breakpoints, stacks, watches and code hovers, the information they needed to solve the bug was being lost is the mix.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/the-lost-art-of-the-print-statement/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 12, 2011 9:25 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/hiltmonism-write-code-for-someone-else/>Write code for someone else</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Whether you are just hacking up a script, writing the next must-have app, or working for the man, always be writing code as if someone else has to read it and understand it. Usually, that someone else is you, six months into the future, older, wiser, with a different mindset. And you&rsquo;d hate to piss yourself off then, right?
This hiltmonism is a big one.

&mldr;it comes with your Amazon account information preloaded, along with &ldquo;1-Click&rdquo; ordering. That means anyone who is holding that device can place an order, whether it&rsquo;s their account or not.
My question is whether this behavior is by design or by accident. In Almost No-one Changes Their Settings I referred an example from Microsoft where the settings were the result of what the developer left them as, not what was best for the user.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/07/kindle-fire-lets-kids-charge-up-a-storm/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 7:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/hiltmonism-information-not-data/>Information, not Data</a></h1><p class=summary-body>How many times have you opened a spreadsheet or a system, and seen pages and pages of numbers and gone &lsquo;Ugh, its too hard to find what I want!&rsquo;.
Most systems and spreadsheets try to present everything to their users, reams and reams of raw unfettered data. And most users, if you ask them, both want the data and hate the data volume that they have to deal with. Looking closer at the situation, the reason they want the raw data is because they believe they can use the data to get answers to their questions, or use the data to do their jobs.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/hiltmonism-information-not-data/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
