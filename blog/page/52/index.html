This value of technical people in startups diminishes quicker than you think and entrepreneurs need to be careful not to give away equity to developers who are super valuable in the short term, but end up twiddling their thumbs in the long term.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/dont-give-up-on-your-techs/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 13, 2011 9:10 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/the-usage-lifecycle/>The usage lifecycle</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Joshua Porter writes about the Usage Lifecycle in Designing for the Social Web: The Usage Lifecycle, well worth reading.
The stages in the Usage Lifecycle of a product are:
• Unaware This isn’t so much a stage as it is a starting point. Most people are in this stage: completely unaware of your product.
• Interested These people are interested in your product, but are not yet users. They have lots of questions about how it works and what value it provides.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/the-usage-lifecycle/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 12, 2011 9:28 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/the-lost-art-of-the-print-statement/>The lost art of the print statement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Debugging software is hard, especially if you were not the original author. All programming languages come with debugging tools, from the arcane GDB to the dead sexy step-through debuggers in Xcode and Visual Studio.

With all the data in the world on their screens, breakpoints, stacks, watches and code hovers, the information they needed to solve the bug was being lost is the mix.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/the-lost-art-of-the-print-statement/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 12, 2011 9:25 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/hiltmonism-write-code-for-someone-else/>Hiltmonism - Write code for someone else</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Whether you are just hacking up a script, writing the next must-have app, or working for the man, always be writing code as if someone else has to read it and understand it. Usually, that someone else is you, six months into the future, older, wiser, with a different mindset. And you&rsquo;d hate to piss yourself off then, right?
This hiltmonism is a big one.

&mldr;it comes with your Amazon account information preloaded, along with &ldquo;1-Click&rdquo; ordering. That means anyone who is holding that device can place an order, whether it&rsquo;s their account or not.
My question is whether this behavior is by design or by accident.

Most systems and spreadsheets try to present everything to their users, reams and reams of raw unfettered data. And most users, if you ask them, both want the data and hate the data volume that they have to deal with. Looking closer at the situation, the reason they want the raw data is because they believe they can use the data to get answers to their questions, or use the data to do their jobs.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/hiltmonism-information-not-data/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 6:49 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/dont-be-a-free-user/>Don't be a free user</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Maciej Ceglowski, writing on the Pinboard blog in Don&rsquo;t Be A Free User calling it as it is.
Someone builds a cool, free product, it gets popular, and that popularity attracts a buyer. The new owner shuts the product down and the founders issue a glowing press release about how excited they are about synergies going forward. They are never heard from again.
His point is valid. All the businesses he refers to started as a free service, had no business model, got sold and died.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/dont-be-a-free-user/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 9:42 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/good-news-online-retailers-do-not-hate-their-customers/>Good news - online retailers do not hate their customers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sarah Perez gets it completely wrong writing in a Techcrunch article entitled Retailers Aren’t Ready For iPad Shopping Trend
Now for the bad news. Despite the increases in tablet traffic, many retailers are not prepared to accommodate these new mobile shoppers. Compuware also prepared a chart showing the top retailers’ sites, and whether or not they offered an iPad-optimized website. Surprisingly, none of them do, not even Apple.com. What’s worse, Apple is also among the retailers who don’t offer a native iPad application.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/good-news-online-retailers-do-not-hate-their-customers/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 4, 2011 11:43 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/zittrain-misses-the-point/>Zittrain misses the point</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Via slashdot, directly quoted:

Strict coding standards are actually an intellectual relief because they remove all those decisions and give you a specific way to do the syntax. (The same of course goes for reading other people&rsquo;s code - your eyes can immediately start looking at the functionality, not try to figure out the current syntax)
Don&rsquo;t forget that using a great architecture, having great conventions and a strict coding standard takes this up to the next level.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/the-argument-for-coding-standards/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
