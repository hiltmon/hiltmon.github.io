All blog posts, all knowledge base notes, all written using Byword. But I really liked the look of iA Writer, so I made Byword’s font look more like iA Writer’s (see Text Editing Fonts and Colors). Perfect.
I even started a “why I prefer one over the other” post, but it only contained one item:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/29/back-to-byword-from-ia-writer/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 27, 2012 5:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/27/hiltmonism-workflow-is-functionality/>Workflow is Functionality</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Functionality, the range of operations that can be run in a computer system, is the foundation upon which all software product collateral, designs, discussions and comparisons are based. Customers buy on functionality. Developers create functionality. Users question what the product can do.
That is fine, but it’s not the whole story.
The right question is not what operations exist (or should exist), it’s how these operations work together, how the functionality flows.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/27/hiltmonism-workflow-is-functionality/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 26, 2012 8:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/26/multi-platform-editing-is-sublime/>Multi-Platform Editing is Sublime</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the best things about the Sublime Text 2 license is that it&rsquo;s a per-user license. This allows you to run it on all computers where you are the primary user. And since Sublime Text 2 is multi-platform, that means on all the operating systems you use as well.
For example, in my case, I can and do run Sublime Text 2 on
My laptop Macintosh which is my regular workhorse.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/26/multi-platform-editing-is-sublime/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 24, 2012 4:49 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/24/one-year-old/>Hiltmon.com - One Year Old</a></h1><p class=summary-body>On Nov 22, 2012, the revamped hiltmon.com turned one year old.

If you have listened to the Men at Work song Down Under, you&rsquo;ve heard of this magical foodstuff.
Here&rsquo;s how to do it right.
The Ingredients 2 x slices of bread (most prefer fluffy white, I prefer a wholegrain brown). One is never enough, and more than two is only allowed after a vigorous rugby game.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/22/vegemite-sandwich/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 17, 2012 2:08 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/17/day-one-icloud-sync-fail/>Day One iCloud Sync Fail</a></h1><p class=summary-body>This post seems to have become popular. To clarify, the problem is with iCloud, Day One is just plain brilliant and you should all be using it.
I use the Day One journalling program a lot, especially to log commits and all social activity using Slogger. But today I noticed that the Journals on all my devices were out of sync, and new entries created were not passed on to other devices.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/17/day-one-icloud-sync-fail/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 16, 2012 12:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/16/it-does-not-have-what-we-can-and-will-not-use/>No Sale: It does not have what we can and will not use</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As a buyer of software, I always focus on what the software does do. If it does what I need to do well, and the price is right, I buy it, I use it and I gain the productivity benefits from it.
As a seller of software, I find potential customers focus on what the product does not do, and use this as a reason to avoid purchasing. That’s fine as long as the missing feature is something they can and do or will use.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/16/it-does-not-have-what-we-can-and-will-not-use/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 15, 2012 4:18 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/15/python-zen/>Python Zen</a></h1><p class=summary-body>After reading Federico Viticci&rsquo;s Automating iOS: How Pythonista Changed My Workflow, I think its time I added the Python Programming Language to my repertoire.
The first thing I learned about Python is the Zen of Python by Tim Peters:
Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense.

This plugin supports:
Multiple web properties as long as they are under the same Google login. Multiple dates so you can skip a few Slogger run days and catch up (or back fill). Only logs a full day&rsquo;s worth of stats, so if it runs now, it logs up to yesterday&rsquo;s stats.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/14/google-analytics-logger-for-slogger/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 12, 2012 6:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/12/another-reason-why-i-love-this-community/>Another Reason to love this Community</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Friendly competition, another reason to love this community.
The gang at App.Net just released their new integrated stream marker feature.
The first response I see (at the top) is from Manton Reece (TW: @manton, ADN: @manton), the maker of Tweet Marker that competes with this feature, congratulating them on their implementation.
