But too many people are either unable to, or are unwilling to, rationalize.
&ldquo;I hold this opinion because I&rsquo;ve read the facts and thought it through&rdquo; matters. &ldquo;I hold this opinion, and that&rsquo;s it&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t.
Ian Betteridge
Whether the argument is about creative design, system architecture, which restaurant to eat at or politics and religion, it&rsquo;s critically important to express, clarify and declare the rationalization behind it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/01/and-this-is-why/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:17 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/i-love-debugging/>I love debugging</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Rob Galankis tongue-in-cheek writing in Why I hate Test Driven Development:
&mldr; So why do I hate TDD?
Because debugging is fun. There, I said it. I love debugging. I think lots of clever people like debugging. I love someone having a problem, coming to me, looking at it together, getting up to walk around, look at the ceiling, talk to myself, stand in front of a whiteboard, draw some lines that spark some idea, try it, manually test a fix out, slouch down in my chair staring at my computer lost in thought, and repeating this until I actually find and fix the problem.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/i-love-debugging/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/photoshop-etiquette-for-web-designers/>Photoshop Etiquette for Web Designers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There is a brilliant list of things web designers should be doing when designing web apps in PhotoShop at the photoshop etiquette manifesto for web designers. Do these and we developers will have a much easier time implementing your designs.
Applies to iOS app designers, Mac App designers, in fact any app designers too.
From now on, all my designers will be asked to follow these rules.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 31, 2012 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/makers-schedule-managers-schedule/>Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Classic article by Paul Graham in 2009 called Maker&rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&rsquo;s Schedule.
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&rsquo;re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.
There are two types of schedule, which I&rsquo;ll call the manager&rsquo;s schedule and the maker&rsquo;s schedule. The manager&rsquo;s schedule is for bosses. It&rsquo;s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/31/makers-schedule-managers-schedule/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 4:16 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades/>The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brilliant post by Wil Shipley on his blog called The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades, well worth a read:
Right now developers selling through the Mac App Store face a lose/lose choice: either provide all major upgrades to existing customers for free (thus losing a quarter of our revenue), or create a “new” product for each major version (creating customer confusion) and charge existing customers full price again (creating customer anger).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/the-mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2012 10:47 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/on-digital-hoarding/>On Digital Hoarding</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Melinda Beck writing in the WSJ in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303404704577305520318265602.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">Drowning in Email, Photos, Files? Hoarding Goes Digital</a> presents a fact-less and ridiculous claim that we are doing something <em>wrong</em> by storing all the emails and files that we do. In the article, she equates the rest of us, people and companies alike, with those crazy nutters who fill their houses with junk.</p><p>My take: We, especially businesses, need to keep all old emails under law in case of subpoena, just like individuals need to store tax records. We need all our old work files as they are referenced in later works. We need our music and photo files because we no longer have their physical equivalents (or have to buy them again and again in case of media).

The same can be said for the fictitious 4G on my iPhone 4S.
As a proud Aussie, I am a fan of the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) and Australia&rsquo;s Trade Practices Act that supports them. In short, companies cannot lie or mislead customers in any way, or the ACCC can nail them and force them to make things right.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/27/ipad-4g-misleading/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 25, 2012 1:26 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/25/freemium-simulation-games-prove-stupidity/>Freemium Simulation Games prove Stupidity</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I don&rsquo;t get the allure and popularity of freemium time-based simulation games like Farmville, DragonVale, Tap Zoo, and Smurfs Village.

They are slow, skill and challenge lacking, chore-based, time-draining, naggy, annoying proofs of stupidity. The only conclusion I can draw from this experience is that people don&rsquo;t value their time, have no self-respect and are just plain stupid to be playing and spending money on these products. &ldquo;Men in Black&rdquo; got it right: &ldquo;A person is smart.
