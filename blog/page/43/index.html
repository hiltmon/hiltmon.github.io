For updates see 2012 Year End iPad Essentials.
The new iPad arrived yesterday. Instead of restoring from a backup, I decided to build it clean and install only essential apps. Here are the ones (excluding games) that made it in the first 24 hours, pretty much in order of addition:
iBooks - I read a lot of ePub books on the iPad, and the new retina text rendering is so great.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/17/2012-ipad-essentials/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 17, 2012 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/17/with-in-app-coins/>With In-App Coins, We're all Losers</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>There are a lot of games on the iPhone App Store that offer in-app purchases of game currency in order to enable players to either speed up the game, or to buy their way to higher levels, without adding additional content.

All posts start as ideas and notes jotted down in nvAlt, Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s fork of Notational Velocity. I like this product because the search and use of notes is fully integrated, and it supports markdown. I have set it up so that all notes are stored as markdown files in a Dropbox folder and Byword has been set up as the external editor.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/15/my-blog-writing-workflow/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 14, 2012 7:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/14/get-to-read-quicker/>Get to read quicker</a></h1><p class=summary-body>People come to hiltmon.com to read, and occasionally to comment on the writing found here.

Why? Longevity and Productivity. I choose the range to suit my needs and skill levels. And the long-term benefits of productivity and time savings way exceed the short-term incremental cost.
All my devices last forever because I purchased the top-of-the-line within the range I needed. In 1998, I purchased the best Dell Inspiron laptop, it lasted until 2003 when I moved to the best Titanium PowerBook, which lasted until 2009 when I acquired my current MacBook Pro.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/top-of-the-line/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 9, 2012 11:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/writing-on-the-ipad/>Writing on the iPad</a></h1><p class=summary-body>This comment by JohnDoey (reproduced in full without permission) on the Asymco article The new feeds and speeds: iPad vs. MacBook Air and iMac sums up the iPad writing experience beautifully (although I think the iPad is a good production system too):
I&rsquo;m a writer also. You missed a key point about writing on iPad.
Writers who are using iPads are not using them like Macs (or Mac clones,) they are using them like typewriters.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/writing-on-the-ipad/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 9, 2012 9:44 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/09/ipad-on-two-years-of-use/>iPad - On Two Years of Use</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Can you believe it, the iPad has been around only two years, two! Yet it feels like there was never a time before we had them.
I was one of those who pre-ordered the original iPad on launch (and the iPad 2 on its launch). I also wrote three blog posts back then, and it seems my usage patterns have not changed that much:

.markdown
That is all. No others.
Make it so!
Update: It seems the GitHub .md extension is becoming canonical for those who prefer shorter file names. And Dr Drang @drdrang uses it. Who am I to argue. But I&rsquo;ll be sticking with .markdown.
I suppose I&rsquo;d better say why:
We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/07/the-markdown-file-extension/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
