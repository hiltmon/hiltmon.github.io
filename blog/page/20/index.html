This is a follow-on to a 10 part (and growing) series I wrote about the thinking and work done. My goal is to share just how much effort it really does take to craft an iPhone app and ship it. I hope this series helps you to understand why it costs so much and takes so long to create beautiful software.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/07/timetocall-after-one-month/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 6, 2013 12:36 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/06/defend-your-livelihood/>Defend your Livelihood</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Adii Pienaar, of WooThemes, in Don’t Be Defensive, But Defend Your Livelihood on dealing with negative reviews:
1. Be Transparent. The honest truth about all companies (and businesses in general) is that it&rsquo;s impossible to please every single customer.

Hilton Lipschitz &lt;me@hiltmon.com> I have yet to find a single occasion when I wanted anything but the email address part.
To correct this issue, jump into a terminal session and use:

Good for him.
But somehow the haters have come out in droves, even though Andy himself tried to head them off at the pass:
This isn&rsquo;t the story about how Apple has lost its way and no longer innovates.

Why make a Video? There is no trial on the App Store, so the next best thing is a quick video to help people decide whether the App does what they want.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/05/timetocall-demo-video/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 2, 2013 12:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/02/better/>Better?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>We all seem to spend a lot of time looking for better things, writing about them and arguing that our choices are better than others&rsquo; choices of things.

We&rsquo;re all wrong, what is better for one is not better for all, because we all have different utility functions.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/02/better/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 28, 2013 5:57 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/28/timetocall-first-updates-coming-soon/>TimeToCall - First Updates Coming Soon</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I&rsquo;ve received some great feedback and a few bug reports on TimeToCall and spent some time trying to make it a better product. The next decision is when to pull the trigger and put the first update through the App Store review process.
Changes The two big changes I have made so far are a more accurate slider and the time now toggle.
In the original release, I set the time slider to jump to 15 minute increments to make it easier to hit a &lsquo;zero&rsquo; time.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/28/timetocall-first-updates-coming-soon/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 27, 2013 12:46 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/27/have-a-better-agenda/>Have a Better Agenda</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Many, many years ago I went on one of those corporate week-long training courses to learn how to negotiate. Back then I was too young and too green to learn anything from it except I remember this mantra:
The only way to win against someone with an agenda is to have a better agenda.
At the time, I never quite understood what that meant. I think I have a better handle on it now.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/27/have-a-better-agenda/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 26, 2013 11:48 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/26/buyreply-email-text-tweet-to-buy/>BuyReply: Email, Text, Tweet, Click to Buy</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Prior to online purchases, the only innovation in purchasing was credit cards. The move to online electronic purchasing has seen only one more real innovation, 1-click by Amazon. The current online purchasing experience really just replicates the same onerous manual purchasing process that’s been around since money was invented.
Until now.
With BuyReply, purchasing is as far away as an email, text or tweet. Completely frictionless. Completely effortless.
