If you have a great idea, you should be talking about it, you should be selling it. If you have an alpha level product, you should be finding beta testers, you should be selling it.

I assume he does not live in the USA or Japan. Back in Australia in the 1990&rsquo;s I certainly would have answered no, everything was BPay and a card swipe. In Japan in the early naughts, the answer was yes, they still hold on to cash as a primary form of exchange because its polite, but now do most smaller transactions via SUICA.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/06/does-money-even-exist-anymore/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 6, 2012 10:03 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/06/bandwidth-caps-never-necessary/>Bandwidth caps never necessary</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The carriers blame a small proportion of their users with hogging all the available bandwidth on their networks and thus explain why their networks are so slow. They then use this excuse to cap and throttle their users, us, and to charge us more per month.
I call bullshit.
There is plenty of backbone bandwidth available, its cheap and its getting cheaper, and carriers buy it in bulk. There is just no rational profit in it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/06/bandwidth-caps-never-necessary/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 5, 2012 6:48 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/05/my-favorite-mac-apps-of-2011/>My Favorite Mac Apps of 2011</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of my favorite Mac apps for 2011.

Rubbish.
In iOS, if it aint on the screen or playing music, it aint running and it aint using memory or battery.

A lot of us our too willing to accept roles as consumers in society. I understand the economic reasons for that, but I don&rsquo;t think it leads to a fulfilling life or a sustainable community. The best way out of this is to deconstruct what you&rsquo;re consuming, or better yet to become a creator yourself.
