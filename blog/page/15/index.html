Gonna keep writing though.
As of this week, I&rsquo;m back in the saddle in the finance industry, designing and developing leading edge platforms and systems for a new asset manager, my favorite kind of business. The challenges in the new firm are new to me and epic. And I love a good challenge.
How does this affect&mldr;

Pinboard is a paid for bookmarking site that focuses on speed, utility and longevity (and anti-socialness!). Pinbrowser is an iPhone and iPad application to access your Pinboard, other&rsquo;s bookmarks (making it more social) and the all famous popular bookmarks list.
It&rsquo;s the social aspect that attracted me to the product in the first place.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/19/pinbrowser-updated/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 15, 2013 12:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/15/wwdc-2013-post-game-review/>WWDC 2013 Post-Game Review</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>Just under a week ago, Tim Cook walked out on stage to present the keynote at WWDC 2013 (<a href=http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2013/>Video here</a>).

In the past I used a commercial ODBC driver. But ODBC on OS X was deprecated ages ago.
In this post, I&rsquo;ll talk about my current stack for accessing SQL Server databases via Ruby and Python and how to set it up.

I could reach out and touch my family and whomever wandered into the house.
As a teenager, I got a bicycle, and my horizon was the neighborhoods within cycling range. I could reach out and touch my friends in nearby neighborhoods. And I felt less constrained.
Later, I learned to drive, and my horizon grew to the city I was living in.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/06/horizons/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 1, 2013 8:51 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/01/sharing-reminder-lists/>Sharing Reminder Lists</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Looking for a quick and easy way to share reminders with other people? Here&rsquo;s how we do it.
My wife and I share a Reminders.app list called Groceries that we check on the way home. If there is anything on the list, we pop into the shop and pick it up.
Reminders.app is an Apple app included in iOS and the Mac that enables you to create lists, set reminder dates or reminder locations.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/01/sharing-reminder-lists/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 30, 2013 4:59 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/30/google-analytics-for-status-board-server-edition/>Google Analytics for Status Board Server Edition</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Google has finally deprecated their GAPI interface which this used to talk to Google Analytics, sorry folks, it will no longer work.

I often create point form lists of things, whether planning a post or a coding sprint or a client activity. And to keep track of which points in the list are done and which will not be done, or what is right and what is wrong, I like to use ✓ and ✗ symbols.
I use them so frequently and am so lazy that even typing ,,tick and ,,cross TextExpander expansions are too much effort.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/28/sanity-saver-ticks-and-crosses/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 28, 2013 12:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/28/my-mac-indie-writing-workflow/>My Mac Indie Writing Workflow</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few years, I have been writing more and more on my Mac, whether it be single blog posts, blog series, systems documentation, knowledge bases and other articles.

You all may remember letterheads from back in the day when companies had professional printers print their fancy logos on fancy paper that you then ran through the &ldquo;good&rdquo; laser printer that then went into matching fancy envelopes and someone stuck stamps on and mailed them.
I thought that letterheads went the way of the dodo about the same time fax machines and US Mail both died out.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/05/23/letterhead-markdown-style/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> is Cofounder and CTO of <a href=https://openyld.com>OpenYield</a>, building the next generation Bond Marketplace.
