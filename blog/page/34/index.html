They then bring out a litany of reasons which boil down to two: the current systems cannot do it and current processes cannot support it. Therefore, management cannot make the change. And if management cannot make the changes, may the business cannot compete, cannot be successful and cannot continue.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/01/hiltmonism-lead-the-business/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 30, 2012 1:04 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/30/if-the-nbc-olympics-team-did-the-nfl/>If the NBC Olympics team did the NFL</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The current NBC Olympics coverage is the absolute worst thing to ever happen to TV, sports and the Olympics. Talk about #NBCFail, here’s it is in context if the NBC Olympics team were responsible for NFL broadcasts:
You would only see games played by one chosen team Only people with cable subscriptions could watch the chosen game of the week Only people with cable subscriptions could watch the selected game on the internet Only people with cable subscriptions could read about the game in the newspaper NBC will ensure other broadcasters do show any clips of any games on their channels or on the internet at any time Expats outside the USA will be unable to watch any NFL, ever They would only show the plays by this chosen team where they score points, to protect the audience from watching the boring bits of the game (like the actual game itself) One exception to the scoring play rule: if another team does something completely stupid or embarrassing, they&rsquo;ll show that too, but only a short clip, and repeat it many times The one game shown would be tape delayed until Thursday night to prepare the audience for the upcoming weekend&rsquo;s games (which they cannot watch) While the other team has offense, or the chosen team is not scoring, they will show hours of sad, sobby backstories about chosen team&rsquo;s players tough upbringings They would never show any injuries to protect the feelings of the audience They would never show any umpire decisions to protect the feelings of the audience They would never show any cheerleaders to protect the feelings of the audience They would never show any team changeovers to protect the feelings of the audience When people complain on twitter, they will &ldquo;embrace the feedback&rdquo;, and ignore it (oh wait, this is the third olympics I&rsquo;ve seen and they&rsquo;re still ignoring the complaints) They will interrupt the stream of advertising only for a few moments every hour to show the scoring play, backstory or softball interview with an old player from the chosen team The commentators will, of course, have never watched an NFL game before, being chosen for the whiteness of their teeth or largeness of their, er, eyes.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/30/if-the-nbc-olympics-team-did-the-nfl/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 24, 2012 8:37 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/24/the-value-of-apps/>The value of Apps</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The online conversation on the Sparrow sale continues unabated. But in amongst all the vitriol, I found some amazing articles written long before the sale pretty much predicting how it is now. Here are some great quotes and links.
Guy English, in Software Sea Change:
An Application represents the developer’s best effort at creating software that applies the capabilities of the device to solving a specific problem. Making people laugh is not a problem an Application can solve; it’s not about the device it’s about the person using it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/24/the-value-of-apps/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 23, 2012 7:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/23/low-app-prices-unsustainable/>Low app prices unsustainable</a></h1><p class=summary-body>David Barnard, of AppCubby, writing in The Sparrow Problem, where he competently works out that the sales and income numbers for Sparrow were not enough to sustain the team, and therefore the business, concludes:
The age of selling software to users at a fixed, one-time price is coming to an end. It’s just not sustainable at the absurdly low prices users have come to expect. Sure, independent developers may scrap it out one app at a time, and some may even do quite well and be the exception to the rule, but I don’t think Sparrow would have sold-out if the team — and their investors — believed they could build a substantially profitable company on their own.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/23/low-app-prices-unsustainable/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 23, 2012 10:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/23/how-many-99c-apps-it-takes-to-afford-that-guy/>How many 99c apps it takes to afford that guy</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Drew Crawford, jumping in on the Sparrow story in Let’s talk about Sparrow, actually covers another area I have been trying to find the words for, why good, experienced software developers, like myself, cost real money:

But they did not buy the company for the product, the bought the company for its people - the talent. Sparrow, the product, is done for.
Facebook also executed a talent acquisition on Acrylic, makers of Pulp, an RSS reader, and Wallet, a secure store.

I purchased the kit that included the bracket (they call it a data doubler), the tools and the SSD:

There are two kinds of innovations in tech.
