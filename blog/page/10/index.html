Yep, I&rsquo;m chilling and writing a blog post while replacing the entire data scaffolding of my firm as if it were just another cold Saturday. Magical indeed.
TL;DR: Rails migrations and Capistrano deploys create a stable, reliable, testable, reversible and no-fault way to manage and execute production database changes, no matter the platform size or complexity.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/08/magical-migrations/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 4, 2014 8:01 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/04/view-on-an-insider-as-ceo-for-microsoft/>View on an Insider as CEO for Microsoft</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, Microsoft announced Satya Nadella as its new CEO, a 22-year veteran of the business and a true Insider. I wish him the best of luck and success. But is choosing an Insider as CEO good for a mature Microsoft or bad?
I think its a bad call based on documented history of other mature companies and my own selfish (and very positive) wishes for the firm.

There are many ways it does this but today I want to talk about auto-pairs and completions.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/01/20/more-textmate-2-basics/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 19, 2014 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/01/19/reminder-update-your-tools/>Reminder: Update your Tools</a></h1><p class=summary-body>At the start of every new year, I spend a the time to update all my tools and recompile all my products with them.

But it&rsquo;s a trap. Almost all programmers and libraries require Python 2 when Python 3 is out and way better. Choosing to use an old language for new project traps us into supporting old languages, libraries and platforms. And that&rsquo;s not smart. The intent of this post is to point out this odd stagnation and encourage the migration and adoption of Python 3, or, as it has happened in the past, we&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere for a solution.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/01/04/python-its-a-trap/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 27, 2013 9:26 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/27/cant-innovate-anymore/>Can't innovate anymore, my ass</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few days I have seen so many references to the Quartz post 2013 was a lost year for tech that it has become a meme. &ldquo;Innovation is dead&rdquo;, &ldquo;2013 proves it&rdquo;, &ldquo;RIP Innovation&rdquo;, it screams.
Rubbish!
2013 was a great year for innovation in the tech space.
in·no·vate /ˈinəˌvāt/ verb
make changes in something established, esp. by introducing new methods, ideas, or products. Remember, innovation is not about creating something completely new (that&rsquo;s invention), it is about making changes to established products that significantly improve their abilities or experience.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/27/cant-innovate-anymore/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 25, 2013 12:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/25/writers-thank-you/>Writers: Thank You</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I want to say thank you to a bunch of writers, to people who do what they do because they love to do it, from an anonymous one that reads and appreciates what they do every day.
