JOBS: One of the things that really hurt Apple was after I left, John Sculley got a very serious disease.
It&rsquo;s the disease &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen other people get it too &ndash; it&rsquo;s the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work.
And if you just tell all these other people, you know, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this great idea,&rdquo; then of course they can go off and make it happen.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/29/its-that-process-that-is-the-magic/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2014 8:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/27/using-os-x-tools-to-build-a-linux-only-product/>How I use OS X Tools to build a Linux-only Product</a></h1><p class=summary-body>OS X really is a developer&rsquo;s dream platform, a solid UNIX core on which almost everything compiles with a brilliant graphical environment hosting the most amazing developer tools.
It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; in the above sentence that has recently tripped me up.
I have a new vendor library that does not compile or run on OS X (yet!). As this is a big project which I will be working on for months, I want to set up my development environment so that I am comfortable and productive.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/27/using-os-x-tools-to-build-a-linux-only-product/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 20, 2014 12:21 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/20/open-source-compiles-in-an-xcode-5-world/>Open Source Compiles in an Xcode 5.1 World</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So today I needed to work on an older, open-source based C++ application on my Mac and there was no way to compile it under Xcode 5 even though the development tools were installed and working perfectly.
The issue, it seems, is that Xcode 5.1 has finally removed and deprecated a lot of old C++ stuff that is still required by older, popular libraries such as boost and quickfix. It emulates g++ 4.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/20/open-source-compiles-in-an-xcode-5-world/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 15, 2014 1:12 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/15/develop-locally/>Develop Locally, Stage Nearby, Production Anywhere</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the things that surprised me as I moved back into the land of corporate software is the number of developers I talk to that commute and work in offices and yet develop on remote computers. I thought, as you probably do, that by now all software development would be local, as in on the developer&rsquo;s own computer.
Instead, it is not uncommon for corporate developers to rely on remote shells or desktop virtualization to access remote development computers and use them to code.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/15/develop-locally/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 2, 2014 10:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/02/from-tool-maker-to-tool-user/>From Tool Maker to Tool User</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Abstract: Programming is still seen as a single-language, single-platform tool-maker role. That has not been true for a long time. Over the years, the platforms, tools and libraries available have multiplied. We&rsquo;re tool users now, where a programmer can pick up a new platform with ease, and use the tools available to create complex, reliable products a lot quicker. That which was impossible then is commonplace now.
The role of the programmer has changed over the years, from being a certified single language, single platform tool-maker into a master of application styles, technologies, use cases and platform tool-users.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/02/from-tool-maker-to-tool-user/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 22, 2014 2:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/22/easy-ssh-to-local-linux-vm/>Easy SSH to local linux VM</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TL;DR: Run avahi on the VM, ssh to the VM name dot local.
Many of the Simple C++ Projects I work on, whether I use Xcode or not, land up needing to be recompiled on a Linux Virtual Machine prior to being deployed to the production Linux server. I do this because I want to be sure the I know what needs to be set up in the Linux environment, that the compile succeeds without errors in a production-like environment and the code works properly before deploying.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/22/easy-ssh-to-local-linux-vm/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 17, 2014 11:53 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/17/choose-not-to-be-anonymous/>I Choose not to be Anonymous</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A simple premise.
I always post from my own domains or accounts, all of which are traceable back to me. I sign and add my true byline, which is me, to all my work. I always use my name, hiltmon, when commenting or responding on other sites or services. Anyone can always get in touch with me via this web site, email, Twitter, App.Net, Facebook, Google+, Linked-In and other services, I am not hiding.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/17/choose-not-to-be-anonymous/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 8, 2014 11:46 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/08/magical-migrations/>Magical Migrations</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As I am writing this, I am using magical migrations to perform a full data transplant across three servers, each with 100+GB of data, with a single command. Yep, I&rsquo;m chilling and writing a blog post while replacing the entire data scaffolding of my firm as if it were just another cold Saturday. Magical indeed.
TL;DR: Rails migrations and Capistrano deploys create a stable, reliable, testable, reversible and no-fault way to manage and execute production database changes, no matter the platform size or complexity.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/08/magical-migrations/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 4, 2014 8:01 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/04/view-on-an-insider-as-ceo-for-microsoft/>View on an Insider as CEO for Microsoft</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, Microsoft announced Satya Nadella as its new CEO, a 22-year veteran of the business and a true Insider. I wish him the best of luck and success. But is choosing an Insider as CEO good for a mature Microsoft or bad?
I think its a bad call based on documented history of other mature companies and my own selfish (and very positive) wishes for the firm.
And then there&rsquo;s this, which makes no Outsider sense and means nothing to anyone, from his first letter to employees:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/04/view-on-an-insider-as-ceo-for-microsoft/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 1, 2014 2:52 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/01/first-they-came-for-dot-dot-dot/>First they came for...</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A Modern Version First they came for the record storesand I didn&rsquo;t speak outbecause I used iTunes online.
