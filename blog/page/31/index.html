As a maker of software products, I often get asked whether my product supports ‘Export to Excel’.
Most developers say yes, here is your spreadsheet and yes, the product has ‘Export to Excel’. My answer is different, it’s sometimes and no, and this is why.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/29/export-to-excel-is-a-red-flag/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 28, 2012 2:29 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/28/entitlement/>Entitlement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Excellent post by Aaron Mahnke called Entitlement about all those moaning about the new iPhone (although I think it applies to all new products), please read and share it:
Where is the sense of gratitude and wonder that we used to have? A tech company sells millions and millions of an amazing smart phone, but decided to create a new model by investing untold amounts of money and energy. And then they released it for the same price as the last model.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/28/entitlement/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 27, 2012 5:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/windows-8-preview-on-a-tablet/>Windows 8 Preview on a Tablet</a></h1><p class=summary-body>While on holiday, I got to play with the Windows 8 Preview on a Samsung tablet. It made some notes of the experience, then decided to wait until I returned home to see what I remembered about the experience.
The tablet itself was larger than the iPad, a lot thicker, a lot heavier and had a lot more ports. It also came with a stylus and a keyboard dock which was useful in turning it into a laptop when needed.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/windows-8-preview-on-a-tablet/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 27, 2012 3:29 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/bye-bye-skitch/>Bye bye Skitch, Hello LittleSnapper</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Editor&rsquo;s Note: Written six months ago, I&rsquo;ve since moved on to using Glui - a better Skitch to replace Skitch.
Bye bye Skitch I’ve been using Skitch to grab screenshots since the first beta was announced way back in June, 2007. I paid for Skitch Plus in February 2011 because I loved the product, and the work by Plasq, so much. Then Evernote purchased Skitch and I hoped that they would not mess it up.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/bye-bye-skitch/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 24, 2012 4:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/24/new-ios6-cached-maps/>New iOS6 Cached Maps</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One feature I do like about the new Maps in iOS 6, the vectors and data are now cached. Seems the application caches the last viewed maps, so the GPS works rather well when offline.
Screenshot taken near Zushi station in Japan, with no WiFi or cellular data enabled.
Note also that the detail in semi-rural Japan seems pretty good.</p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 20, 2012 8:02 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/20/the-best-sushi/>The best Sushi</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If you love traditional Japanese sushi, not the Western or Californian styles, then I have found the best sushi place in the world. But you had better hurry of you want a chance to eat there, the sushi chef is getting old.
Getting There The restaurant is in Kanazawa city on the Japan Sea side of Japan, about 450 km north-west of Tokyo. Getting there is easy if you take a shinkansen (bullet train) about half the way and an express train the rest of the way, give yourself 5-6 hours of travel from Tokyo.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/20/the-best-sushi/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 19, 2012 6:18 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/19/buying-a-new-suitcase/>Buying a new Suitcase</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My suitcase broke on the way back to Japan from Australia, so we decided it was time to buy a new one. As usual, the geek in me meant that we could not just run down to the local Yodobashi Camera and purchase the first one we found (although I did spend a lot of time prodding the ones there). I need facts and information to make the right decision.

&ldquo;Hello Hilton&rdquo; you all say.
I seem to have a lot of text manipulation tools on my devices. Of course, I don’t think I have too many, but most people only seem to have one. You see, to me, each one has it’s own use, it’s the best tool for it’s job, that’s why I have and use it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/25/text-editor-addict/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 25, 2012 11:33 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/25/thwarted-by-patents/>Thwarted by Patents</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As you all know, teleportation is easy. But one cannot make a teleporter due to the crazy US Patent system. And it&rsquo;s frustrating me.
Like you all, I am pretty tired of traveling to airports via trains and monorails, waiting in check-in lines, fighting those darn kiosk things, standing in baggage lines, standing in TSA lines, removing shoes and belt, getting frisked, getting dressed then waiting in dingy boarding areas with horrid coffee and no useable wifi only to spend hours upon hours squished in small cramped seats with bland food and annoying strangers, just to get somewhere.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/25/thwarted-by-patents/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 22, 2012 8:58 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/22/care/>Care</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As a species , we have proven that there is nothing we can’t do if we set out to do so. We have cured the incurable countless times before. I fervently believe that, if we can send robots to Mars and fix elections with money, we can cure cancer. All it takes is the same thing it always has for every one of those challenges…
Care.
