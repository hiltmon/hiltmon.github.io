Seems the application caches the last viewed maps, so the GPS works rather well when offline.

But you had better hurry of you want a chance to eat there, the sushi chef is getting old.
Getting There The restaurant is in Kanazawa city on the Japan Sea side of Japan, about 450 km north-west of Tokyo. Getting there is easy if you take a shinkansen (bullet train) about half the way and an express train the rest of the way, give yourself 5-6 hours of travel from Tokyo.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/20/the-best-sushi/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 19, 2012 6:18 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/19/buying-a-new-suitcase/>Buying a new Suitcase</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My suitcase broke on the way back to Japan from Australia, so we decided it was time to buy a new one. As usual, the geek in me meant that we could not just run down to the local Yodobashi Camera and purchase the first one we found (although I did spend a lot of time prodding the ones there). I need facts and information to make the right decision.

&ldquo;Hello Hilton&rdquo; you all say.
I seem to have a lot of text manipulation tools on my devices. Of course, I don’t think I have too many, but most people only seem to have one. You see, to me, each one has it’s own use, it’s the best tool for it’s job, that’s why I have and use it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/25/text-editor-addict/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 25, 2012 11:33 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/25/thwarted-by-patents/>Thwarted by Patents</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As you all know, teleportation is easy. But one cannot make a teleporter due to the crazy US Patent system. And it&rsquo;s frustrating me.
Like you all, I am pretty tired of traveling to airports via trains and monorails, waiting in check-in lines, fighting those darn kiosk things, standing in baggage lines, standing in TSA lines, removing shoes and belt, getting frisked, getting dressed then waiting in dingy boarding areas with horrid coffee and no useable wifi only to spend hours upon hours squished in small cramped seats with bland food and annoying strangers, just to get somewhere.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/25/thwarted-by-patents/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 22, 2012 8:58 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/22/care/>Care</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As a species , we have proven that there is nothing we can’t do if we set out to do so. We have cured the incurable countless times before. I fervently believe that, if we can send robots to Mars and fix elections with money, we can cure cancer. All it takes is the same thing it always has for every one of those challenges…
Care.

Something has gone very wrong in American coverage of news from abroad. It is shoddy, lazy, riddled with mistakes, and excessively simplistic.
Above all, it is absent.
Mainly this is why:
In the event of a massive breaking story—such as the uprisings in Tahrir Square—the networks parachute their people in.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/20/where-is-the-international-news/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 18, 2012 12:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/18/att-effs-users-again/>AT&T effs users again</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The beard, Jim Dalrymple nails it in AT&T fucks users… again:
“Our network sucks balls. If we tried to let all of you rapid iPhone users have FaceTime, our network would take a firey crash into Hell. Many of the executives that have been too goddamn cheap to upgrade the network are now scared shitless that they will lose their cushy bonuses. So we decided to fuck our users.”
Why? AT&T is only allowing cellular FaceTime if you buy into their new overpriced and underserviced family share plans.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/18/att-effs-users-again/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 17, 2012 2:08 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/17/hipstamatic-fires-its-devs/>Hipstamatic fires its devs</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Of all the stupid things to do, Hipstamatic fired its 3 devs, 1 designer and writer yesterday.

So in case you didn’t get the memo. Entire team laid off. 3 devs, 1 designer, 1 writer. Some of THE best people I’ve ever worked with…
