Computers are also great at following along the same mind numbing process over and over again (we call this programming), yet we tend as users of computers, to perform these tasks manually on our computers.
Today&rsquo;s Hiltmonism is very simple. Automate or die. Make the computer do the work so you can have a life.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/hiltmonism-automate-or-die/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 4, 2011 9:55 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/the-best-steve-jobs-quote/>The best Steve Jobs quote</a></h1><p class=summary-body>This may be it.
&ldquo;When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you&rsquo;re life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/the-best-steve-jobs-quote/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 3, 2011 9:52 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/03/the-four-hour-rule/>The four hour rule</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Programming is a craft of the mind. Programmers need to think through the feature they are writing, build up the code and a solution in their heads, maintain the product architecture, structure and conventions in the background and plan and design the next part of the code they are assembling. And then they need the time to execute all that. Once in The Zone™, programmers are exceptionally productive.

If you’re primarily in the market for an e-reader, get an e-ink device. And if you’re looking for a tablet for apps, games, and videos in addition to reading, unless the iPad’s price is absolutely out of the question forever, I suggest getting the iPad.
And the e-ink winner unsurprisingly is the current Kindle (called the Kindle 4 in the review).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/e-reader-roundup/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 2, 2011 6:47 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/no-service-competition-in-new-york/>No Service Competition in New York</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Just a quick check on my choices for 21st century data services available at my apartment in New York city:
Internet, Landline, Television Time Warner Cable Verizon FIOS Oops, only TWC from today based on the agreement reached where Verizon quit the land-based business (See Susan Crawford&rsquo;s article: Smug and chagrined). So no choice.
Mobile Phone AT&T Verizon T-Mobile (still a dead spot after 8 years) Sprint (same as T-Mobile) Neither work well, so I have to stick with AT&T because at least they have a MicroCell.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/no-service-competition-in-new-york/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 2, 2011 6:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/data-caps-dont-work/>Data caps don't work</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Nate Anderson, writing for Ars Technica in Data caps a &ldquo;crude and unfair tool&rdquo; for easing online congestion

In other words, they tell me their answer to a puzzle, without explaining what the puzzle is, and expect me to understand what to do.

This happens a lot in software design.
