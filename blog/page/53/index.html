&mldr;it comes with your Amazon account information preloaded, along with &ldquo;1-Click&rdquo; ordering. That means anyone who is holding that device can place an order, whether it&rsquo;s their account or not.
My question is whether this behavior is by design or by accident. In Almost No-one Changes Their Settings I referred an example from Microsoft where the settings were the result of what the developer left them as, not what was best for the user.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/07/kindle-fire-lets-kids-charge-up-a-storm/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 7:22 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/hiltmonism-information-not-data/>Information, not Data</a></h1><p class=summary-body>How many times have you opened a spreadsheet or a system, and seen pages and pages of numbers and gone &lsquo;Ugh, its too hard to find what I want!&rsquo;.
Most systems and spreadsheets try to present everything to their users, reams and reams of raw unfettered data. And most users, if you ask them, both want the data and hate the data volume that they have to deal with. Looking closer at the situation, the reason they want the raw data is because they believe they can use the data to get answers to their questions, or use the data to do their jobs.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/hiltmonism-information-not-data/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 6:49 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/dont-be-a-free-user/>Don't be a free user</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Maciej Ceglowski, writing on the Pinboard blog in Don&rsquo;t Be A Free User calling it as it is.
Someone builds a cool, free product, it gets popular, and that popularity attracts a buyer. The new owner shuts the product down and the founders issue a glowing press release about how excited they are about synergies going forward. They are never heard from again.
His point is valid. All the businesses he refers to started as a free service, had no business model, got sold and died.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/dont-be-a-free-user/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 9:42 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/good-news-online-retailers-do-not-hate-their-customers/>Good news - online retailers do not hate their customers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sarah Perez gets it completely wrong writing in a Techcrunch article entitled Retailers Aren’t Ready For iPad Shopping Trend
Now for the bad news. Despite the increases in tablet traffic, many retailers are not prepared to accommodate these new mobile shoppers. Compuware also prepared a chart showing the top retailers’ sites, and whether or not they offered an iPad-optimized website. Surprisingly, none of them do, not even Apple.com. What’s worse, Apple is also among the retailers who don’t offer a native iPad application.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/good-news-online-retailers-do-not-hate-their-customers/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 4, 2011 11:43 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/zittrain-misses-the-point/>Zittrain misses the point</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Via slashdot, directly quoted:

Strict coding standards are actually an intellectual relief because they remove all those decisions and give you a specific way to do the syntax. (The same of course goes for reading other people&rsquo;s code - your eyes can immediately start looking at the functionality, not try to figure out the current syntax)
Don&rsquo;t forget that using a great architecture, having great conventions and a strict coding standard takes this up to the next level.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/the-argument-for-coding-standards/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 4, 2011 9:59 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/hiltmonism-automate-or-die/>Automate or Die</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Computers are excellent at performing dull repetitive structured tasks, yet many organizations use armies of people to perform these tasks. Computers are also great at following along the same mind numbing process over and over again (we call this programming), yet we tend as users of computers, to perform these tasks manually on our computers.
Today&rsquo;s Hiltmonism is very simple. Automate or die.

&ldquo;When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you&rsquo;re life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/the-best-steve-jobs-quote/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 3, 2011 9:52 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/03/the-four-hour-rule/>The four hour rule</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Programming is a craft of the mind. Programmers need to think through the feature they are writing, build up the code and a solution in their heads, maintain the product architecture, structure and conventions in the background and plan and design the next part of the code they are assembling.

If you’re primarily in the market for an e-reader, get an e-ink device. And if you’re looking for a tablet for apps, games, and videos in addition to reading, unless the iPad’s price is absolutely out of the question forever, I suggest getting the iPad.
And the e-ink winner unsurprisingly is the current Kindle (called the Kindle 4 in the review).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/02/e-reader-roundup/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
