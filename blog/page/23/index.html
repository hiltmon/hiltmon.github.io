Yet we do continue to judge people, just these days it&rsquo;s by their devices.

That person is an open-source neck-beard with their incomprehensible 1976 vintage text editor running on a cheap ChromeBook.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/30/clothes-make-the-man/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 30, 2013 11:29 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/30/timetocall-building-the-core/>TimeToCall - Building the Core</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TimeToCall is a simple, universal iOS application I developed to help people choose the best time to call when calling internationally.

“Hmmmm Hello”

“Er Hi Mum”

“Mum”

“MUUUM”

“Do you know what the time is?”
&mldr;
“I know it’s after work in Sydney, but it’s 3AM here in New York”
&mldr;
“Yes I was sleeping”
&mldr;
“No, no, I’m awake now”

“Just please check the time before you call”
Never know when is the best time to call people overseas?
TimeToCall is coming soon for the iPhone and iPad.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/25/time-to-call-coming-soon/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 24, 2013 9:38 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/24/dog-with-a-bone/>Dog with a Bone</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I think one thing that is unique about programmers is that we are tenacious about getting a problem solved. As tenacious as a dog with a bone to chew. It irks us when things are not perfect, but instead of ignoring it or putting up with it, we put in the time and effort to solve it. No matter how small the niggle.
Maybe it’s simply because we can. Or maybe we’re anal or crazy.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/24/dog-with-a-bone/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div></section></article></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
