People stopped buying computers based on specifications and features years ago. All computers sold now are practically identical in functionality. Today, people are increasingly buying computers the same way they buy cars: to define themselves.
I own Apple products because I love fine software, I drink 12 year old scotch because I like fine drinks, I use a Nikon camera because I adore fine photography equipment and I celebrate at fancy restaurants because I really enjoy fine foods.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/16/products-define-you/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 16, 2012 12:44 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/16/newspapers-paywalls-and-core-users/>Newspapers, Paywalls, and Core Users</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Clay Shirky exposes the story behind Newspapers, Paywalls, and Core Users.
As a heavy consumer of news, my biggest problem is finding good old-fashioned journalism in a world of spin, hype, agendas, placements and sponsored content. I worry that we&rsquo;re entering a world where the truth becomes what other people have paid for me to read because journalists have no other way to finance an honest service.
This isn’t a problem with general-interest paywalls — it is the problem, widely understood before the turn of the century, and one to which there has never been a convincing answer.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/16/newspapers-paywalls-and-core-users/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 16, 2012 12:21 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/16/how-google-failed-to-fix-the-mobile-market/>How Google failed to fix the mobile market</a></h1><p class=summary-body>MG Siegler, in his blog parislemon, wrote an excellent but badly titled article called Why I Hate Android on how Google blew its, and therefore our, chances at an equitable mobile phone market in the USA.
Google wanted to give-away or sell Android phones unlocked in stores and allow consumers to then choose their carrier. Consumers could then get the best phones, a great operating system, all updates and choice in carriers, something the iPhone only gets us half way to.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/16/how-google-failed-to-fix-the-mobile-market/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 11, 2012 10:55 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/11/it-should-only-take-you-a-few-hours-dot-dot-dot/>It should only take you a few hours...</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It sure seems easy to make a table. Anyone can do it, right? Get 1 large flat rectangular piece of wood, 4 equally tall wooden poles, 4 nails and a hammer. Nail the 4 poles to each corner of the flat rectangular bit, and you have a table. Ta daaa!
Now ask a carpenter to craft you a table. First they will spend time discussing the purpose and function of the table - indoor or outdoor, kitchen or dining room, for show or heavy use, what load does it need to bear.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/11/it-should-only-take-you-a-few-hours-dot-dot-dot/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 11, 2012 9:39 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/11/why-patents-are-a-big-problem/>Why patents are a big problem</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Brad Lindenberg nails it in Why patents are a big f******* problem
There has to be a correlation between ideas and execution otherwise those who can execute get shafted by those who cannot.

I assume he does not live in the USA or Japan. Back in Australia in the 1990&rsquo;s I certainly would have answered no, everything was BPay and a card swipe.
