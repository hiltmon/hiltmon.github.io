Well, if it looks like a duck, floats like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. The just-released Microsoft Surface RT fails the duck test, it looks like a tablet, but it is not a tablet. Windows 8 RT also fails the duck test, it looks like Windows 8, but it is not Windows 8.
For the record, I have used the real proper Windows 8 on a Samsung tablet before, so my impressions of the Surface and Windows RT are based on that experience.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 27, 2012 11:39 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/>Marco and the Surface</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment, of Instapaper and The Magazine fame, went to a Microsoft Store yesterday to try out the new Surface and wrote about the experience in his blog in An alternate universe. Go read it. I’ll wait.
I’m sad to say but I think I may have to agree with his conclusion:
But it’s not for me at all. Not even for testing, experimenting, or curiosity. It feels too much like using a Windows PC, which was exactly Microsoft’s intention, and it will appeal to people who want that.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 25, 2012 2:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/>Windows 8 Launch MIA</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So I sat back today to watch the live stream of the Microsoft Windows 8 launch. I was excited, this is the first Windows launch that interested me since Windows 95. And I waited for them to show me the product, its features and its pricing. And I waited, and waited, and then the show ended. Information about Windows 8 was missing in action at the launch.
Now I know that the press has had it for ages.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/windows-8-launch-mia/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 25, 2012 12:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/>Apple vs Microsoft Launch Differences</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I started a post on the Windows 8 Launch which I will get back to later, because there were some very key differences between the two presentations and they really resounded with me. Some of them stylistic, some fundamental, you choose which.
Microsoft: “will”, Apple: “is”. A lot of the Microsoft presentation was all about “will”, you will be more productive, you will have more device choices, you will enjoy, you will do X better.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/25/apple-vs-microsoft-launch-differences/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 24, 2012 3:38 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/>Email Etiquette</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I don’t know about you, but I get a lot of emails across a lot of accounts and the time and effort to process my inbox is growing exponentially. I just wish that senders and responders on email would follow some basic etiquette rules that will make our use of email both more pleasant and more productive.</p><p>Email is a form of communication which is a reflection of you. Bad email etiquette reflects badly on you, and a record of this is kept in mailboxes over which you have no control. Good email etiquette reflects well on you, improves your public perception and persona and increases the chance of a prompt and comprehensive response. It’s not hard to maintain good email etiquette once you know what it is.</p><p>One thing before we start, before creating or responding to an email, ask yourself this: is email the right medium for this communication? If you are not sure, pick up the phone or wander over to the person and have a conversation. Email only if it is the right medium.</p><p>And always follow good etiquette. This article contains a comprehensive list of rules and recommendations learned through experience and research.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 24, 2012 9:51 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/>The Big 5 Windows 8 Lineups</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My thoughts on announced hardware for Windows 8 being released this week.
Asus Asus will be launching their Zenbooks with touch screens for Windows 8 in November, or really replacing the screens on their old Zenbooks with touch screens and selling them as new models.
They are updating their modular tablet to run Windows RT and calling it the Vivo Tab RT. 10.1” with a dock for the low price of $599.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 23, 2012 8:15 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/23/thered-be-something-called-a-mini/>There’d be something called a mini</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My thoughts on today’s announcements by Apple.
13” Retina Macbook Pro The 13” Retina Macbook Pro looks good, is priced high as expected, and is probably going to sell very very well. But the 8GB RAM limit and the lack of an external graphics card to drive the Retina display is puzzling. The 15” has an external NVIDIA GT 650M and can go up to 16GB RAM, that makes it a pro machine.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/23/thered-be-something-called-a-mini/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 22, 2012 5:23 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/22/the-myth-of-the-wireless-spectrum-crisis/>The myth of the wireless spectrum crisis</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Great article by Tim Farrar, a real pro on Gigaom entitled The myth of the wireless spectrum crisis, presents the fact that wireless data growth has stalled because of tiered pricing, low caps and market saturation instead of growing out of control:
However, underlying the statistics are numbers that tell a far different story: in fact, there was a dramatic slowdown in wireless traffic growth during the first half of 2012.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/22/the-myth-of-the-wireless-spectrum-crisis/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 22, 2012 12:05 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/22/huge-last-week-in-october-2012-for-tech/>Huge Last Week in October 2012 for Tech</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It’s going to be a huge week in tech this week, with launches and events from the big three, Microsoft, Google and Apple. Here’s what happening and my take on each.
Microsoft Windows 8 and Surface On October 25, 2012, Microsoft will hold an event to launch their new Windows 8 Operating System for release the next day. I expect to see more demos of the system itself, a lot more Metro, er Windows UI, style applications and some great hardware that is tuned for it, especially touchable wrap-around laptops from Lenovo and Acer.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/22/huge-last-week-in-october-2012-for-tech/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div></div><div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 22, 2012 11:36 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/22/solutions-born-from-deep-experience/>Solutions born from deep experience</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Comment of the Day:
That clearly illustrates the difference between charging for our time and charging for our experience. Clients want cheap, quick fixes, but we sell solutions born from deep experience. The latter is worth more.
