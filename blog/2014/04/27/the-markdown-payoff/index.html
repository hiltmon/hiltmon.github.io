Did it pay off? And if so, how?</strong></p><p><span class=light>I actually wrote this post not knowing how it would turn out. I wanted to know for myself if it paid off, or if I just followed a fad. A fun exercise.</span></p><h2 id=bm-before-markdown>BM (Before Markdown)</h2><p>Before Markdown, I wrote less. I rarely blogged, took occasional notes using pen and paper and often forgot things. If it was not sent via email, I did not have it. Sounds familiar, no?</p><p>For plans, manuals and other work documentation, I used <a href=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/>Microsoft Word</a>, just like everyone else (See <a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/10/13/why-microsoft-word-must-die/>Why Microsoft Word Must Die</a>). I was one of those people who used document styles, but still found myself spending heaps of time formatting my work and then reformatting after other people&rsquo;s edits.</p><p>For everything else, I scribbled notes in a cheap, paper notebook <em>that I never read</em>, on post-it notes <em>that stacked up</em> or on the back of printouts <span class=light>(remember when we printed stuff?)</span> <em>that got thrown out</em>.</p><p>Other than <em>after-the-fact</em> documentation, I had no useful records of meetings, designs, thoughts, decisions or what I did. And remembered little of what was said, why things were done or what was done.</p><p>It was because I did not have these things that I looked for a simple solution, one that would work for me, and I found Markdown formatted files. I created my own <a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/20/the-markdown-mindset/>Markdown Mindset</a></p><h2 id=am-after-markdown>AM (After Markdown)</h2><p>Since I started writing Markdown formatted files, I have created lots of them: meeting notes, assembly notes, support notes, design decisions, journalling, project documentation, business documents, ideas, proposals, statements of work, contracts, README files, server configurations, copies of quotes and even to-do lists. <em>Everything that I may have written or jotted down is now in a Markdown file.</em> And everything that I was to lazy to record, I now do, in a Markdown file.</p><p><em>I write more</em>. In fact, I write a <em>lot</em> more. I take my laptop (and now <a href=http://www.apple.com/ipad/>iPad</a>) into meetings and take notes that I save. I have <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bbedit/id404009241?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894">BBEdit</a> open at all times with the current project&rsquo;s notes open, and habitually switch to it to jot down thinking, ideas or even the commands I use. If I get interrupted, I jot a note in a blank Markdown document.</p><p>Because I have these files available at my fingertips, I can always get back to what was discussed, what I was thinking or what I did. All the valuable (and useless) information previously lost in the write-only notebook, the stacked post-its or the missing printouts is saved and searchable.</p><p>I write everything using Markdown. I write my blog using Markdown in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894">Byword</a>. I write my specifications and longer documents in Markdown using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scrivener/id418889511?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894">Scrivener</a>. I write everything else in Markdown using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bbedit/id404009241?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894">BBEdit</a>. Add these all up and the cost is still less than a copy of <a href=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/>Microsoft Word</a>.</p><p><strong>But is all this paying off?</strong></p><h2 id=payoff-wins-quantitatively>Payoff Wins (Quantitatively)</h2><p>The payoff is quite measurable. Binary in fact. I <em>have</em> the information I need and I can <em>find</em> it. Versus <em>not</em> having it!</p><p>I have created over 1,600 Markdown files over the past two years. That&rsquo;s a lot of note taking. I often find myself searching for &ndash; or going back to &ndash; these notes so see what I did, what I was thinking or what, and most importantly, why decisions were made. Having the information helps resolve disputes or explain why things were done.</p><p>If having these files is good, being able to find them by content is better. Paper notes are hard to search. Markdown files, being plain text, are perfect for <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2531?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US">Spotlight</a> search (or whatever indexing your Operating System uses). I can type in a search phrase and all the matching notes are right there.</p><p>To aid search, I use <a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/18/markdown-metadata/>Markdown Metadata</a> to tag files and add keywords (and sped up using <a href=http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/>Keyboard Maestro</a> macros). To aid in selection, I use a file naming convention (see <a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/15/text-notes-going-electronic>Text Notes - Going Electronic</a>) that identifies the file kind (meeting, note, idea, etc) and its project and date (and sped up using <a href=https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html>TextExpander</a> snippets).</p><p><strong>The quantitative payoff is clear, I have the information I need in a portable and searchable format and I can get to and create these very quickly, efficiently and productively.</strong></p><h2 id=payoff-feeling-qualitative>Payoff Feeling (Qualitative)</h2><p>The quantitative payoff, however, comes from the qualitative payoff. These files exist because I have the discipline and tools to create them. And the discipline exists because I <em>want</em> it to.</p><p>Since switching to Markdown, I <em>want</em> to write. I <em>want</em> to take notes, I <em>want</em> to record my thoughts and ideas properly, I <em>want</em> to document things. And after two years of doing it, I still <em>want</em> to write. This is no fad. Markdown takes the hassle out of writing, and removes the barriers to get started.</p><p>Not only do I want to write more, I want to write better. I&rsquo;m a programmer by trade, not a writer <span class=light>(as can be divined by the quality of writing in this blog)</span>. But because I write more, I want to become a better writer. I want my documentation to be clearer and appear more professional, my blog posts to make more sense and even my emails to be more concise. I feel that as a better writer, I can be come a better communicator and that is best for all.</p><p>The key to Markdown writing is that you focus on the content. Structure, format, look and feel are all secondary. It&rsquo;s pure distraction-free writing. <strong>Which means that you have no choice but to write and think about writing and focus on the content.</strong> Which encourages you to become a better writer.</p><p>The other issue with writing is that it takes time, but the payoff of Markdown is that you land up spending less time doing it. With no distractions and fast tools, more writing gets done. What you do with the time you gain is up to you, but for me, it means I write even more.</p><p>And since I want to (and do) write more, I lose less, forget less and understand more.</p><p><strong>The qualitative payoff is that you want to write, you therefore write more, leading to having more notes available when you are looking back.</strong></p><h2 id=the-payoff>The Payoff</h2><p>To answer my starting questions, then:</p><p><em>Was switching to Markdown a good call?</em> <strong>Yes!</strong></p><p><em>Did it pay off?</em> <strong>Yes!</strong></p><p><em>And if so, how?</em></p><p><strong>I write more, I write better, and I <em>have</em> the information I need available at my fingertips.</strong> I also spend less time writing, almost no time formatting (thanks to <a href=http://marked2app.com>Marked</a>), and am more productive because I always know what is (or was) going on.</p><p><em>Follow the author as <a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a> on Twitter and <a href=http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a> on App.Net.
