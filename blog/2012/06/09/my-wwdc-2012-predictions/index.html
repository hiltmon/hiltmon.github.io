So here it is, my WWDC 2012 keynote predictions, what I think in my opinion, without rumor or factual basis, will be covered at the WWDC 2012 keynote on Monday:</p><ul><li><strong>Sales</strong>: Apple has had its best year ever, and Tim Cook will enjoy sharing the numbers. And he should!</li><li><strong>OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion</strong>: We&rsquo;ll get a clearer release date and a top 10 new feature demo. At least 8 will be features we already know, and one will be a lot more on the Messages app. Maybe a new developer beta, but it&rsquo;s not ready yet.</li><li><strong>iOS 6</strong>: The next iOS will be announced, without a release date (so that they can do it with the next iPhone), but us developers can get started developing for it. I do expect new maps, new background process options, and a new version of Siri. But after the US 4G marketing bungle, I expect the next iOS and iPhone to be a more world phone than a US one and so the next iOS update will be incremental software, not radically new.</li><li><strong>iCloud</strong>: It was announced last year, it will get more features this year. Now that MobileMe is gone, I expect iCloud to take on some of its features, such as photo galleries and maybe personal web hosting. But more, I expect that iCloud synching will just work better.</li><li><strong>Apple TV</strong>: Nothing new here, it was updated recently.</li><li><strong>Apple applications</strong>: I expect new versions of the iLife and iWork suites. Neither has been updated in ages (iWork was in January &lsquo;09), and all would work better with iCloud (Their iOS versions already do). I do not expect any of the Pro applications to be updated, they&rsquo;ll save that for another event.</li><li><strong>Hardware updates</strong>: I expect Mac Pro updates as we developers love our Mac Pro&rsquo;s (see my <a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/03/the-last-of-the-workstations/>The Last of the Workstations</a>). And probably a 15" MacBook Pro update. But no laptop retina displays (or it&rsquo;s going to cost me!).</li><li><strong>Steve Jobs</strong>: It&rsquo;s been 9 months, and I think Apple will spend a small amount of WWDC keynote time just remembering him. And this will be the last time they bring Steve Jobs up in public.</li><li><strong>No &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo;</strong>: That&rsquo;s it, no new product lines, no TV, just good old operating system and developer updates.</li></ul><p>I also predict:</p><ul><li>Having a hard time following the liveblogs as the event&rsquo;s networks fail. And watching the event video Monday evening to see what I missed.</li><li>A large number of articles to be written on how disappointed people are in Apple&rsquo;s announcements because they did not release <em>insert magical made up feature here</em>. Or that this <em>insert same magical made up feature here</em> was pulled at the last moment because it was not ready, so the made up sources did not lie.</li><li>The share price to drop, because it always does.</li><li>A bunch of blowhards saying how Steve Jobs did a much better keynote than Tim Cook, ignoring the fact that the last few keynotes were the Scott Forstall and Phil Schiller show as well, with Jobs as MC.</li></ul><p>In the mean time, I&rsquo;ll be ensconced in front of all my monitors from 1PM EST on Monday hanging on to every liveblog and tweet. Don&rsquo;t call, don&rsquo;t write.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, Apple does have a surprise or two up their secretive sleeves. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun.</p></div><p class=post-mark><span class="fas fa-envelope"></span>
