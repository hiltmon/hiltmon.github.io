To clarify, the problem is with iCloud, Day One is just plain brilliant and you should all be using it.</p></blockquote><p>I use the <a href=http://dayoneapp.com>Day One</a> journalling program a lot, especially to log commits and all social activity using <a href=http://ttscoff.github.com/Slogger/>Slogger</a>. But today I noticed that the Journals on all my devices were out of sync, and new entries created were not passed on to other devices. Somehow, sync was jammed up.</p><p>I have Day One on</p><ul><li>My home server where Slogger runs</li><li>My laptop, where I work</li><li>My iPad, where I chill</li><li>My iPhone, where everything needs to be available</li></ul><p>And they are all kept in sync via iCloud. Until 2 days ago. Then it stopped.</p><p>On investigation, it seems there were 29 files inside the iCloud folder for Day One that were grayed out and displaying the OS X progress bar next to them. From what I could tell, these files were supposed to be downloading from iCloud but did not come in. For 2 days they did not download. A check on my iOS devices and the same thing was happening, 29 files were in downloading status and never came down.</p><p>I tried:</p><ul><li>Rebooting all devices, even the server, no change</li><li>Deleting the pending files, and they came back, but remained in downloading state</li><li>Copying them from another system, and they showed up in Day One, but syncing was still busted</li><li>I started to see <code>sandboxd: ([1674]) Day One(1674) deny forbidden-link-priv</code> errors in console, coincidentally, 29 times, for these files</li></ul><p>Short version, iCloud was saying there were 29 updates, and <em>never</em> finished delivering them. And there seems to be nothing you can do to reset or force these to unstick. And I don&rsquo;t think there is anything the developer of Day One can do about it!</p><p>So, I finally gave up. I disabled iCloud syncing on Day One and enabled <a href=http://www.dropbox.com>Dropbox</a> sync instead. The laptop and server switched over OK (once I manually replaced the in-progress files) and creating an entry in one appears in the other.</p><p>On iOS though, things get hairier. These pending updates prevented Day One from accessing its own files, so iCloud sync could not complete disablement. It got to 98% and then just sat there. I had to uninstall the app, turn iCloud Documents and Data sync off in iOS Settings to delete <em>all</em> my iCloud data on the device, then reinstall the app and set it up to use Dropbox instead. Oh, and then re-enable iCloud documents for everything else.</p><p>The restores are in progress, and there are the odd Day One crashes as it restores, but the missing entries have already synced.</p><p>In short, the black-box nature of iCloud sucks when trying to troubleshoot or fix sync errors. The developer of Day One does not pick sides between iCloud and Dropbox sync. I for one, do recommend you sync your Day One data using Dropbox.</p><p><em>Follow the author as [@hiltmon](http : //https://twitter.com/hiltmon) on Twitter or <a href=http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a> on App.Net.</em></p></div><p class=post-mark><span class="fas fa-envelope"></span>
