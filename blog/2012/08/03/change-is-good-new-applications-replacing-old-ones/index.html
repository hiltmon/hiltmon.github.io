And I use a lot of it. I realized today, while fixing a problem on my wife’s laptop, that I have pretty much replaced many older products with new ones on my computer over the last year or so, yet she still uses all the old stuff.</p><p>Change is good for me. I love using new products that improve my productivity, work better or look better. I love trying new products to see if they can replace the ones I am currently using.</p><p>But many computer users prefer the familiar and the traditional. Good for them, let them keep running Windows XP and Office XP and Norton AntiVirus! But they are missing out.</p><p>Here are some of the product switches I have made over the last few years:</p><ul><li><strong>NetNewsWire → Reeder</strong>: <a href=http://netnewswireapp.com>NetNewsWire</a> was the first indie application I ever purchased for the Mac, and was my RSS reader of choice until <a href=http://reederapp.com>Reeder</a> made it across to the Mac. I just love the look and feel of it.</li><li><strong>QuickSilver → Alfred</strong>: I seem to have used <a href=http://qsapp.com>QuickSilver</a> for ever, but as it languished without update, I guess I just got used to time when it did not work. I had tried <a href=http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html>LaunchBar</a> back in the day, but had always gone back to QuickSilver. But now <a href=http://www.alfredapp.com>Alfred</a> and it’s Powerpack do the same job, better and prettier.</li><li><strong>MS Office → iWork/Scrivener</strong>: As <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products>MS Office</a> got slower and slower and more and more bloated, it became harder and harder to use. Even though <a href=http://www.apple.com/iwork/>iWork</a> is old, it’s still faster to load, easier to use and I think <a href=http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/>Keynote</a> is by far the best presentation tool ever. I have also moved most of my long-form writing from MS Word to <a href=http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php>Scrivener</a>, and find myself actually enjoying writing documentation - weird for a programmer!</li><li><strong>CSSEdit/Espresso → Coda 2</strong>: I used to code static web sites in <a href=http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html>BBEdit</a> and used CSSEdit to build the CSS files. I still think CSSEdit was one of the best indie products ever made, but it was merged into <a href=http://macrabbit.com/espresso/>Espresso</a>, which I never fell in love with. I tried Coda 1 for a while, but it too did not stick. <a href=http://panic.com/coda/>Coda 2</a>, on the other had, is brilliant, and I do all my static and Wordpress work in it now.</li><li><strong>BusyCal → Fantastical</strong>: I hated iCal when I moved to the Mac and fortunately, <a href=http://www.busymac.com/busycal/>BusyCal</a> did the trick. It was one of the first applications I installed. But these days, the best calendar application is <a href=http://flexibits.com/fantastical>Fantastical</a>, it sits there on my menubar (not hidden by <a href=http://www.macbartender.com>Bartender</a>) and allows me to quickly add events in plain english, or see my schedule at a glance. Just great. BusyCal is no longer installed.</li><li><strong>Quickbooks → Billings</strong>: I used to use <a href=http://quickbooks.intuit.com>QuickBooks</a> for billing, because my accountant likes the file format. But the product is absolutely awful. <a href=http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/>Billings</a>, on the other had, just works, sits in the menu bar for timing my work and produces great invoices.</li><li><strong>Yojimbo → 1Password</strong>: My “store everything” application has been <a href=http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/>Yojimbo</a> since the day it came out. Everything went in there, serial numbers, passwords, bank accounts, key documents, etc. I tried <a href=http://evernote.com>Evernote</a>, but could never get comfortable with it. But the last few years, <a href=https://agilebits.com/onepassword>1Password</a> has taken over the management of passwords, key numbers (like credit card numbers and passport numbers) and serial numbers. And it’s integration into Safari and Alfred make it even better than ever.</li><li><strong>TaskPaper → VoodooPad</strong>: I used to use <a href=http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper/>TaskPaper</a> formatted documents for project information, with heaps of these text files all over the place. Now each project has it’s own Wiki thanks to <a href=http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/>VoodooPad</a>. All project contacts, logins, names, addresses and core information is stored in one structured file and in one application for each project.</li><li><strong>MarsEdit → Byword</strong>: The move to a baked blog using <a href=http://octopress.org>Octopress</a> and Markdown also meant that my favorite blog writing tool, <a href=http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/>MarsEdit</a>, fell by the wayside. Enter <a href=http://bywordapp.com>Byword</a> stage left, a pretty, minimalist writing application that works great with Markdown. I also use <a href=http://markedapp.com>Marked</a> for preview instead of MarsEdit’s preview window.</li><li><strong>Plain Text → nvAlt</strong>: My non-project notes have always been a mess. I started using <a href=http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/>TextExpander</a> macros to name the files so at least I could guess what they meant, but placing them in the file system was always a problem. With <a href=http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/>nvAlt</a>, all non-project notes have a place on my system, easily found, still in Markdown, shared using <a href=https://www.dropbox.com>Dropbox</a> so I can work on them on the iPad, and easily archived using <a href=http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php>Hazel</a> rules.</li><li><strong>TextMate → Sublime Text 2</strong>: I’m still not comfortable with this change, it’s new. I love, love, love <a href=http://macromates.com>TextMate</a>, it’s the best editor for programming and I have been using it for years. The <a href=http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/>TextMate 2 alpha</a> is pretty good, but not there yet. So I’m trying <a href=http://www.sublimetext.com>Sublime Text 2</a> out. So far, it’s OK, but I’m not loving it. I’m not sure of it’s muscle memory, the look or the way it works. If Sublime Text does not work out, maybe I’ll try <a href=http://chocolatapp.com>Chocolat</a> next.</li><li><strong>Twitterrific → Tweetbot</strong>: This happened today, after years and years of having <a href=http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/>Twitterrific</a> on my dock, <a href=http://tapbots.com/tweetbot_mac/>Tweetbot</a>, the best iOS twitter app by far, has now come to Mac and made it on the dock. Its still an alpha release, so it’s buggy as heck and not recommended to non-techies. But it looks great displaying multiple timelines on its own desktop.</li></ul><p>I have also added new workflows enabled by new amazing tools, such as:</p><ul><li><a href=http://mindnode.com>Mindnode Pro</a> for mind mapping.</li><li><a href=http://macrabbit.com/slicy/>Slicy</a> for project image creation.</li><li><a href=http://dayoneapp.com>Day One</a> for journaling.</li><li><a href=http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/>Soulver</a> for all my calculation needs.</li></ul><p>And some products have remained the constant, like:</p><ul><li><a href=http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html>BBEdit</a> has always been my go-to text editor for any non-standard file work, scratch notes and script editing. <em>This be my hammer tool.</em></li><li><a href=http://panic.com/transmit/>Transmit</a> is still the best safety-net FTP client around.</li><li><a href=http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/>OmniFocus</a> manages all my tasks.</li><li><a href=http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/>OmniGraffle</a> handles all my diagramming.</li><li><a href=http://www.apple.com/ilife/>iLife</a> does the same as it always did.</li><li><a href=http://www.apple.com/aperture/>Aperture</a> still manages my photography hobby.</li><li><a href=http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite.html>Adobe’s Creative Suite</a> still handles the majority of my image work, even though I often use <a href=http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/>Acorn</a> or <a href=http://www.pixelmator.com>Pixelmator</a> for quick tasks.</li></ul><p>With the current mix of new and old, I find myself more productive and a happier computer user. And the best part about this is that indie developers are working on both improving the current flock of products and are creating many new, exciting and better things. It’s a great time to be an early adopter in software.</p></div><p class=post-mark><span class="fas fa-envelope"></span>
