Yet these games are the top grossing games on the App Store. So I decided to take one on to see if I can find the &lsquo;it&rsquo; factor that makes these games so enjoyable, popular and profitable, without paying real money to short-circuit the game.</p><p><strong>tl;dr (Too Long; Didn&rsquo;t Read)</strong>: You have got to be out of your mind to find these &lsquo;games&rsquo; enjoyable or worth spending money on. They are slow, skill and challenge lacking, chore-based, time-draining, naggy, annoying proofs of stupidity. The only conclusion I can draw from this experience is that people don&rsquo;t value their time, have no self-respect and are just plain stupid to be playing and spending money on these products. &ldquo;Men in Black&rdquo; got it right: &ldquo;A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it&rdquo;.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/25/freemium-simulation-games-prove-stupidity/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 24, 2012 12:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/24/giving-yourself-away-with-a-facebook-login/>Giving yourself away with a Facebook Login</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Applications that require a Facebook login are doing so to gain access to you, your name, your friends, your location, your personal details.

My wife asked me why I deleted Draw Something this week, as we were both enjoying drawing pictures with each other. I told her that Zynga purchased them, who Zynga were and why I did not want them to have access to my information.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/24/giving-yourself-away-with-a-facebook-login/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 22, 2012 3:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/22/clarity/>Clarity</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Jason Fried, on the 37 Signals blog, sums it up in What clarity is all about:
Lots of people think simplicity is the opposite of confusion (“It’s confusing, let’s make this simpler”). It’s not.

For the rest of us, Brett Terpstra of Marked and nvAlt fame has released an update to Fletcher Penney&rsquo;s Quick Look generator.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/22/markdown-quick-look/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 17, 2012 1:30 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/17/2012-ipad-essentials/>2012 iPad Essentials</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Editor’s Note: This was written way back in March 2012 with the launch of the iPad 3.

The new iPad arrived yesterday. Instead of restoring from a backup, I decided to build it clean and install only essential apps. Here are the ones (excluding games) that made it in the first 24 hours, pretty much in order of addition:
iBooks - I read a lot of ePub books on the iPad, and the new retina text rendering is so great.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/17/2012-ipad-essentials/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 17, 2012 12:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/17/with-in-app-coins/>With In-App Coins, We're all Losers</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>There are a lot of games on the iPhone App Store that offer in-app purchases of game currency in order to enable players to either speed up the game, or to buy their way to higher levels, without adding additional content.

All posts start as ideas and notes jotted down in nvAlt, Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s fork of Notational Velocity. I like this product because the search and use of notes is fully integrated, and it supports markdown. I have set it up so that all notes are stored as markdown files in a Dropbox folder and Byword has been set up as the external editor.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/15/my-blog-writing-workflow/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 14, 2012 7:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/14/get-to-read-quicker/>Get to read quicker</a></h1><p class=summary-body>People come to hiltmon.com to read, and occasionally to comment on the writing found here.
