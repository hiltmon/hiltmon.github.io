Yet we do continue to judge people, just these days it&rsquo;s by their devices.
That person is a Apple fanboy with their walled garden white earbud iPhone and shiny MacBook Air. That person is an open-source neck-beard with their incomprehensible 1976 vintage text editor running on a cheap ChromeBook.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/30/clothes-make-the-man/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 30, 2013 11:29 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/30/timetocall-building-the-core/>TimeToCall - Building the Core</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TimeToCall is a simple, universal iOS application I developed to help people choose the best time to call when calling internationally.

“No, no, I’m awake now”

Never know when is the best time to call people overseas?

As tenacious as a dog with a bone to chew. It irks us when things are not perfect, but instead of ignoring it or putting up with it, we put in the time and effort to solve it. No matter how small the niggle.
Maybe it’s simply because we can. Or maybe we’re anal or crazy.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/24/dog-with-a-bone/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 23, 2013 9:52 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/23/surface-pro-pricing-madness/>Surface Pro Pricing Madness</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I don’t get the pricing for Microsoft’s new Surface Pro.
The basic, bottom spec unit (with no keyboard, tablet form only) is $899.00. Why would you buy it when you can get full-size iPad at $499.00, or even the top-of-the line iPad at $829.00. Why would you buy it if you specifically want a Windows 8 tablet and a Samsung Activ goes for under $699.00 (and includes the keyboard).
And if you do add the keyboard for $120 (which pushes the price over $1,000) to use the Surface as a laptop, why not buy the best laptop ever made, the MacBook Air for $999.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/23/surface-pro-pricing-madness/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 19, 2013 2:05 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/19/browser-windows-on-all-desktops/>Browser Windows on all Desktops</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In Being Productive With Virtual Desktops, I talked about how I pin certain applications to certain Mission Control virtual desktops to create context specific environments.
Reader “zharmany” asked what I did with the web browser, since it is needed on many of these desktops for different reasons.
My needs are to have separate browser windows on Desktop 1 / Work for previews, on Desktop 3 / Mail for mail links and on Desktop 4 / Social for looking at tweeted links, so I do not pin Safari.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/19/browser-windows-on-all-desktops/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 19, 2013 12:54 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/19/sanity-saver-nomoreitunes/>Sanity Saver: NoMoreiTunes</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sanity Savers are quick tips that help you stay sane when using your computer.
I really don’t like it when you web browse to the App Store (iOS or Mac), it also launches iTunes or the App Store App on top. If I want to buy the app, I’ll click myself, I do not want my browsing flow to be interrupted by the launch of another application.
The NoMoreiTunes Safari Extension prevents this from happening.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/19/sanity-saver-nomoreitunes/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 17, 2013 10:16 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/17/being-productive-with-virtual-desktops/>Being Productive with Virtual Desktops</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There are a bunch of applications I always want running on my computer, such as Mail.app, OmniFocus, Billings Pro and Tweetbot, but I also do not want to be distracted by them. One option is to hide them using ⌘H on the Mac, the other way is to use virtual desktops.
My goal is to create context-aware desktops where I can stay focussed on the task at hand without distractions, and to be able to switch and restore contexts instantly and predictably, that is most productive.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/17/being-productive-with-virtual-desktops/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 16, 2013 8:04 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/16/rvm-in-textmate-2/>RVM in TextMate 2</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I use Ruby Version Manager (rvm) to manage the interpreters and gemsets for all of my projects. But the default install of TextMate 2 uses the system ruby interpreter for internal command execution as well as for external runs. Here is how to use your rvm environment for both.
tl;dr: Set the TM_RUBY variable in preferences or your ~/.tm_properties file to the path returned by which rvm-auto-ruby and restart. That will set the internal runner.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/16/rvm-in-textmate-2/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/25/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/23/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 23 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.social/@hiltmon rel=me>Mastodon</a> &#183;
