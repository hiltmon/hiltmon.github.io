I did not update it for iOS 7 (or iOS 8) and it&rsquo;s starting to look shabby. I never made any worthwhile money from it or received blog pageviews from it. There are newer and better products out there. I do not want to clutter the App Store with yet another abandoned product. It no longer showcases my development capabilities, they are far better now.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/02/timetocall-removed-from-app-store/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 1, 2014 9:09 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/01/any-hint-of-humanity-is-valued/>Any hint of humanity is valued</a></h1><p class=summary-body>For decades we have had corporatization, mass-production, and everything becoming the same, having personality drained from it. That became what was common and what was the norm. And then in the last, you know, 5, 10 years, this concept of like the artisanal, the special, the hand-made, like this is coming back &mldr;
[interruption edited out]
&mldr; I think the reason why everyone loves all this hand-made crap today is because they are starved for authenticity after decades of mass-market personality-less crap, and they are starved for uniqueness, they are starved for personality and they are starved for authenticity and for people to talk to them like, you know, talked to like an adult please.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/10/01/any-hint-of-humanity-is-valued/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 3, 2014 8:25 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/09/03/standard-markdown/>Standard Markdown</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Looks like Jeff Atwood (@CodingHorror), John MacFarlane, David Greenspan of Meteor, and folks from StackExchange, Github and Reddit have put their money where their mouths are and released the first version of Standard Markdown at http://standardmarkdown.com.
I believe this will be the future of John Gruber&rsquo;s (@daringfireball) Markdown.
Up until now, I have relied on Fletcher Penney&rsquo;s (@multimarkdown) MultiMarkdown on the desktop for all my documents because of its consistency, ubiquity and wonderful extensions for writers (including tables and footnotes).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/09/03/standard-markdown/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 2, 2014 11:29 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/09/02/the-quick-code-cleanup/>The Quick Code Cleanup</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The quick code cleanup is a process whereby you run through some or all of the files in a software project and tidy them up. Think about it as the regular tidying of your desk (or room) and filing things away &ndash; versus the rearranging and rewiring of a full code refactor. You can get a lot more done on a tidy desk.
Quick code cleanups can and do include some minor refactoring, but they are mostly about renaming items, reformatting code and commenting on or cleaning up messy sections.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/09/02/the-quick-code-cleanup/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 22, 2014 8:05 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/08/22/aral-on-spyware-2-dot-0/>Aral on Spyware 2.0</a></h1><p class=summary-body>That word is spyware.
Let me state it plainly: Google is a spyware company. Facebook is a spyware company. Any company whose products spy on you is a spyware company.

The first step in understanding and defeating something is to call it what it is.

Neither is any other corporation. It and they do what they do for their own interest and are more than willing to try to make you try believe that what they do for their own benefit is in fact for yours.

Replace Amazon with any company name of your choice and this remains 100% true.

And they all share a lot of common code.
The traditional approach to build and debug this pattern is to create a library of the common code in one project, a separate server project and another client project, then jump between windows to edit and compile where needed.
But I am often coding on my trusty 13" MacBook Air screen and it&rsquo;s just too tiny to have all these Xcode windows open with their console windows visible.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/30/an-xcode-c-plus-plus-client-server-development-trick/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 14, 2014 6:24 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/14/wordcounter/>WordCounter</a></h1><p class=summary-body>WordCounter by Christian Tietze (@ctietze) does one thing, and does it well:
It counts the number of words you type in registered applications and displays the total on the menu bar.
Most writers I know use several different software tools while writing, like nvAlt for notes, Byword for short pieces and Scrivener for the big things. But each of these has a separate word count (if at all). WordCounter brings them all together in one.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/14/wordcounter/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 7, 2014 6:08 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/07/sonicwall-mobile-connect-for-os-x-mavericks/>Sonicwall Mobile Connect for OS X Mavericks</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If you are running OS X 10.8 or lower, please refer to SonicWall NetExtender for OS X Mavericks, this only works for 10.9 Mavericks and above.
Step 1: Download from the App Store
It&rsquo;s available here: Sonicwall Mobile Connect.
There is no Step 2.
The best part of this new edition is that this is a real OS X app and it integrates with Apple&rsquo;s VPN settings.
Which means you only need to run it once, to set up and test the VPN connection.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/07/sonicwall-mobile-connect-for-os-x-mavericks/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 28, 2014 4:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/06/28/they-will-not-come/>They will not come</a></h1><p class=summary-body>&ldquo;If you build it, they will come&rdquo;

On Monday night, June 30, 2014, I&rsquo;ll be taking the Kifu servers down and putting up a static sunset site.
I built it, they did not come. It&rsquo;s time to go dark.
I know we built it right. We spent years looking at the market for non-profit management systems and found thousands and thousands of potential customers publicly expressing real needs.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/06/28/they-will-not-come/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/8/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/6/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
