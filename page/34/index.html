The age of selling software to users at a fixed, one-time price is coming to an end. It’s just not sustainable at the absurdly low prices users have come to expect. Sure, independent developers may scrap it out one app at a time, and some may even do quite well and be the exception to the rule, but I don’t think Sparrow would have sold-out if the team — and their investors — believed they could build a substantially profitable company on their own.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/23/low-app-prices-unsustainable/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 23, 2012 10:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/23/how-many-99c-apps-it-takes-to-afford-that-guy/>How many 99c apps it takes to afford that guy</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Drew Crawford, jumping in on the Sparrow story in Let’s talk about Sparrow, actually covers another area I have been trying to find the words for, why good, experienced software developers, like myself, cost real money:

But they did not buy the company for the product, the bought the company for its people - the talent. Sparrow, the product, is done for.
Facebook also executed a talent acquisition on Acrylic, makers of Pulp, an RSS reader, and Wallet, a secure store.

I purchased the kit that included the bracket (they call it a data doubler), the tools and the SSD:

There are two kinds of innovations in tech. One that is often celebrated – the creation of great new things people will gladly pay for – and another that few companies will brag about – finding new ways to get people to pay for something they already have.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/19/two-kinds-of-innovations-in-tech/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 19, 2012 7:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/19/7-reasons-why-i-cant-do-free/>7 Reasons Why I Can’t Do “Free”</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sharon Hayes clearly explains why she does not work for free in 7 Reasons Why I Can’t Do “Free”, check it out.

For me, when it comes down to it, software will always trump hardware. When I’m using a device like the Nexus 7 I want to know where the details are. Where is the magic? The fun?

Enter rake isolate["x"] to isolate the site down to the selected post. But isolating requires me to note the file name down, there is too much to remember and type and I am lazy.
So have created two macros and a script to speed this process up.
Note: You must run these commands in the root of the Octopress folder, else they will not work at all!</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/18/octopress-post-and-publish/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/35/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/33/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
