The editors I use do not have an importer (they have Quicklook only), so this is not available directly.
Changing the RichText Spotlight importer trick worked in previous versions of OS X (see how in A Simple Markdown Spotlight Importer), but since System Integrity Protection in OS X El Capitan, this no longer works.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/11/17/a-yosemite-markdown-spotlight-importer/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 2, 2015 7:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/11/02/making-and-maintaining-high-resolution-charts-for-indesign-cc/>Making and maintaining high resolution charts for Indesign CC</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the biggest headaches I have using Adobe Indesign is the creation and especially maintenance of charts and graphs. In my case, my fund publishes several high quality books and one-pagers monthly and I need to update a bunch of charts and graphs. I also need to print these at a very high DPI, hence Indesign.
I used to use Adobe Illustrator graphs. They are rudimentary, but very customizable. Every month I had to load an Illustrator file for each image, update the graph data and then spend time tweaking the results.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/11/02/making-and-maintaining-high-resolution-charts-for-indesign-cc/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 14, 2015 7:31 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/10/14/brown-mms/>Brown M&amp;Ms: A Quick Way to Determine Code Quality</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My business runs on code. Every day, my team and I deploy new systems, patches and add new features to our mission-critical code base. And we rarely have a problem.
That&rsquo;s because we have a quick way to determine if the programmer attended to the details of the product and code, and whether we then need to hold the deploy for a deeper check and test or can run a lighter test and confidently push it out.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/10/14/brown-mms/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 4, 2015 1:54 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/10/04/why-i-am-subscribing-to-apple-music/>Why I Subscribed to Apple Music</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Just over 3 months ago, Apple released Apple Music and I signed up for the free trial as we all did. My expectation was that I would play with it for a few days, get over it and never use it again. I expected the same experience I got from Spotify and Pandora before and I never subscribed to them. I expected the same old same old and no reason to use it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/10/04/why-i-am-subscribing-to-apple-music/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 28, 2015 10:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/28/the-simple-c-plus-plus-makefile-executable-edition/>The Simple C++ Makefile - Executable Edition</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I develop a lot of applications in C++ using Xcode on OS X and deploy them to CentOS Linux Servers to run. I follow the Simple C++ Project Structure (and the Xcode edition) to code up each product.
However, Xcode is not available on Linux. To compile and deploy (and to test compiles and deploys), I use standard Unix Makefiles, available almost everywhere.
In this post I will show you the Makefile I use for multi-platform C++ executable builds and explain what each line and command does in detail.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/28/the-simple-c-plus-plus-makefile-executable-edition/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 20, 2015 2:48 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/20/saturday-afternoons-watching-rugby-union/>Saturday Afternoons Watching Rugby Union</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Growing up, Saturday afternoons were for watching Rugby Union games with friends and family. No matter what was going on at home, with friends, at school, or in the country I lived, the world stopped for the two games that were televised live. I am as far away from that world as one can be, yet it is with me right now.
It began with my grandfather. He played as a kid as evidenced by a hook nose and a deep understanding of the game.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/20/saturday-afternoons-watching-rugby-union/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 5, 2015 12:50 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/05/the-it-has-happened-before/>The 'It has happened before, it will happen again.' Apple</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The Apple I know and loved was doomed, so the press said. It was the crazy, emo teenager of a company. Willing to try anything, mad, crazy, radical, different and apt to succeed and fail in spectacular fashion. Against all odds, the Apple of old did not fail. Because of this we now have amazing computers, thin and light laptops, iPods, OS X, iPhones and iPads. Can you imagine a world without Apple products?</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/05/the-it-has-happened-before/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 4, 2015 9:40 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/04/open-extension-less-files-on-os-x-in-your-favorite-editor/>Open Extension-less Files in your Favorite Editor on OS X</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Xcode does a horrible job of editing Makefiles (and other extension-less files like dot-files). If you right-click in Xcode on a Makefile and Open with External Editor, OS X opens it in TextEdit. Which is worse.
The issue is that TextEdit is associated with extension-less files. Usually to change how files are opened, you select the file in Finder, right-click and choose Get Info from the menu. You then choose the editor in the Open with dropdown and click Change All&mldr;.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/09/04/open-extension-less-files-on-os-x-in-your-favorite-editor/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 23, 2015 12:49 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/08/23/how-the-apple-watch-has-changed-my-behavior-for-the-better/>How the Apple Watch has changed my Behavior for the Better</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have the nerd watch, the 42mm Space Gray Aluminum with the Black Sport Band. It was ordered at launch and arrived late. I have been wearing and using it every day since.
The Apple Watch is a perfectly good watch for doing watch-like things, like telling the time. But if you view it as a wrist computer, one that has had a real impact on how one acts and behaves, it is something uniquely special.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/08/23/how-the-apple-watch-has-changed-my-behavior-for-the-better/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 15, 2015 12:42 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/08/15/the-productive-mac-mindset/>The Productive Mac Mindset</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have been using a set of productivity enhancement tools on my Mac for so long now that the standard, out-of-box OS X user experience seems challenging, crawling, cumbersome and somewhat convoluted.
So much so that it has become frustrating for me to use another person&rsquo;s Mac.
In this post, I intend to outline how the limited set of productivity tools I use give me &ldquo;ludicrous speed&rdquo;. Note that I have invested the time to learn these tools and to create the productivity shortcuts they provide.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/08/15/the-productive-mac-mindset/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/6/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/4/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 23 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.social/@hiltmon rel=me>Mastodon</a> &#183;
