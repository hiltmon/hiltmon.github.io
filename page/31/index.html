The open versus closed ecosystem holy war is in full force, with a lot of words written in absolute and extreme terms. Yet the so-called walled garden systems appear to be most popular and most successful.
I believe that in reality these closed ecosystems actually have very permeable walls and that we&rsquo;re really working in the middle ground between open and closed.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/15/walled-gardens-are-permeable/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 14, 2012 11:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/14/the-post-pc-future/>The Post-PC future, iCloud turns one</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Apple&rsquo;s iCloud service turned 1-year old on October 12, 2012. The day passed with a whimper in a tech press focussed on irrelevant issues such scratching, purple flares, maps and other Apple so-called &ldquo;failures&rdquo;.
I think it&rsquo;s a big deal, because with iCloud, Apple may finally be getting internet services right and the post-PC era just got real for most people. And no-one seems to have noticed.
As an early adopter, though, post-PC started early for me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/14/the-post-pc-future/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 13, 2012 12:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/13/fixing-open-with-in-os-x/>Fixing Open With in OS X</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If you use the Open With&mldr; contextual menu on OS X (right-click on a file in Finder), you may find a lot of applications get duplicated or are just plain wrong.

So much noise that Apple is trying to “fix” the problem by not shipping pre-scratched ones, and by telling people that scratching is normal for aluminium products.
I prefer Remy Labesque’s take back in 2011 in Aged to Perfection, the back of scratched iPhones can and does look beautiful.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/scratched-iphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 10:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/>Spent more on Patents than R&amp;D?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Ian Betteridge @ianbetteridge takes the New York Times down in Did Apple and Google really spend more on patents than R&amp;D?, in response to the NYT article The iEconomy: Apple and Technology Manufacturing (Subscription required):
Read the NYT piece, and you would think that the technology market has shifted from being about research and development of new products to being about acquisition of patents. Given that this is based on a single year, when some very big patent portfolios came on the market in one-off deals that aren’t likely to be repeated in the future, that’s a long way from the truth.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 9:56 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/microsoft-lost-its-mojo/>Microsoft Lost its Mojo</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Another well written article today in Vanity Faire, How Microsoft Lost Its Mojo: Steve Ballmer and Corporate America’s Most Spectacular Decline, which visits Microsoft’s lost decade and current structural problems. Well worth Instapering (Is that a word?).
Ballmer’s key business philosophy for Microsoft was so antiquated as to be irrelevant. The Microsoft C.E.O. used to proclaim that it would not be first to be cool, but would be first to profit—in other words, it would be the first to make money by selling its own version of new technologies.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/microsoft-lost-its-mojo/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 9:48 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/bbedit-still-rules/>BBEdit still Rules</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Lovely article on how the stalwart classic BBEdit still rules by Andy Ihnatko (@ihnatko) on Macworld today, entitled Mac classics: Why BBEdit rules
“BBEdit’s still important because at its essential core, it’s a tool for working with text,” says Rich Siegel, Bare Bones Software’s founder and CEO. “Not text for presentation, as in a word processor or page-layout application, but rather text as data supplied to other software: code for compilers and interpreters, markup and Web applications for Web browsers, log files and data tables for analysis, and for any tool that inhales raw text and turns it into something else.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/bbedit-still-rules/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 8, 2012 7:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/08/stop-with-the-old-text-editors-already/>Stop with the old Text Editors already</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few years, it has become a thing to stop using IDE’s and modern text editors in favor of Vim. I understand older programmers using Vim out of habit, but the new generation of programmers? I don’t get it. Every-time I write about text editors, this growing group tweets to give modern GUI editors up and switch to old trusty rusty crusty terminal-based Vim.
Stop it!

Too much glue and your systems and processes become rigid, inflexible and incomprehensible. In technology and in business, you need to minimize the glue.
Let’s start with a few definitions. Lets call a potential interconnection between two systems a path. An interface is code to import or export data from an application. Now we can define an integration as a process whereby data is pulled from one interface, travels down a path and is loaded into another interface.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/08/hiltmonism-minimize-the-glue/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 29, 2012 3:57 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/29/export-to-excel-is-a-red-flag/>Export to Excel is a Red Flag</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As a developer, I often get requests from clients asking me if I could deliver them a spreadsheet using their data from their systems that contains X and Y and Z.
