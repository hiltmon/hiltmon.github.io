And we&rsquo;re creating new ones all the time, whether for new engagements, new personal projects or spikes. I personally like to have all my project files properly organized, every component of the project has its place, so I have been using my own standard project folder layout for years.
Until now. The old one was no longer working.
So I rearranged my standard project folder layout.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/30/project-folder-layout/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 29, 2012 7:18 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/29/iphone-is-5-today/>iPhone is 5 today</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Five years ago, the first iPhone went on sale. My, have mobile phones changed since then.
My Mobiles before the iPhone launch When I first came to the USA, the only phones I could get were pay-as-you-go bricks. After some time, I finally became eligible for a contract phone.
My first was the Verizon V710 flip phone (first left). It was sold as the first phone to allow bluetooth sync between the phone and your computer, so I got that one.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/29/iphone-is-5-today/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 29, 2012 4:05 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/29/syncing-the-desktop-and-the-laptop/>Syncing the Desktop and the Laptop</a></h1><p class=summary-body>For the past few years, I have been working about 5½ days a week on the desktop and 1½ days a week on the laptop. The desktop is a monster 8-core Mac Pro with loads of RAM and my good old 23" Cinema HD Display, which makes it perfect for compiling, graphics work and the usual day-to-day work stuff. The laptop is a mid-2009 MacBook Pro 15", perfect for on-site work and demos.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/29/syncing-the-desktop-and-the-laptop/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 28, 2012 9:47 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/data-presentation-at-its-best/>Data presentation at its best</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One thing we all try to do is to simplify the presentation of data and tell a story. That&rsquo;s why charts, graphs, infographics and dashboards are so popular these days.
At the UEFA site, they created a brilliant way to present the story of the tournament. Instead of the usual brackets with the final in the middle and the upper and lower quadrants blank wasted space, they created a railway network, wherein you can follow the story of each team as the tournament progressed (the lines highlight as you hover over them).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/data-presentation-at-its-best/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 28, 2012 9:07 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/on-the-nexus-7/>On the Nexus 7</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Yesterday, Google announced the Nexus 7, their first hardware and software combination tablet.
In short, and in my opinion, they have created the reference platform for Android tablet development. Pair that with the Galaxy Nexus phone and you have the best Android pair since the iPhone/iPad duo, for development.
But until I need to develop for Android, I&rsquo;m not going to buy one. I already have an iPad and an iPhone.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/on-the-nexus-7/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 28, 2012 8:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/someone-is-coming-to-eat-you/>Someone is coming to eat you</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Michael Lopp, for Rands in Repose, wrote Someone is Coming to Eat You, a brilliant article on success and competition, well worth reading.
Apple’s current biggest competitor is itself, and I think Steve Jobs learned this the hard way - from the sidelines. When he returned, one of his first hires was a gentlemen named Tim Cook, and while Tim Cook holds a degree in industrial engineering, he is not an engineer, a designer, or a poet.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/someone-is-coming-to-eat-you/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 22, 2012 12:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/22/compete-to-maintain/>Compete to maintain, Disrupt to succeed</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There is a huge difference between competing in a market and disrupting a market. When competing, a company tries to make a similar product in a given market segment, then competes against incumbent products on price or features to gain share and hopefully profits. When disrupting, a company produces a whole new product (or a viable derivative) that creates or changes a market, then dominates share and profits in that segment.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/22/compete-to-maintain/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 20, 2012 7:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/non-upgradable-smartphones/>Non-upgradable Smartphones</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, Microsoft announced it&rsquo;s new Windows 8 smartphone platform, and it looks quite good. But they also announced that their recently released Windows 7.x phones cannot be upgraded to Windows 8. Which means all those early Metro interface adopters who purchased the brilliant Nokia Lumia smartphones are screwed until their lock-ins expire in two years time.
It&rsquo;s the same in the Android space, whether caused by manufacturers or carriers, they both seem to spend too much time blaming each other so in my book, they&rsquo;re both responsible.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/non-upgradable-smartphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 20, 2012 10:10 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/single-pay/>Single-pay, Ad-pay or Both-pay?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Author&rsquo;s note: This article makes no point, takes no stand and argues no single position. I wrote it to see if I could come to come conclusion on which of &lsquo;user-pay&rsquo; vs &lsquo;ad-pay&rsquo; vs &lsquo;both-pay&rsquo; makes sense, and failed. But published it anyway to see if it spurs others smarter than me to explain and solve this conundrum.
It used to be in the old days when news was delivered to your home in paper form that the only way to get coupons or know about a sale at Macy&rsquo;s was from the advertising in this newspaper.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/single-pay/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 20, 2012 8:57 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/learn-to-automate/>Learn to Automate</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It&rsquo;s been almost six months since the Codecademy launched learn to code in 2012, headlined by Mayor Bloomberg. Lots of people pledged, lots signed up.
And I&rsquo;ll be flabbergasted if any of them are still doing it.
I&rsquo;m not going to go into why having everybody learn to code is a bad thing in detail, Jeff Attwood nails that in Please Don&rsquo;t Learn to Code. Short version, it puts the method before the problem, programmers like to solve problems and create solutions, and the tool they mostly use is code.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/learn-to-automate/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/38/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/36/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.social/@hiltmon>Mastodon</a> &#183;
