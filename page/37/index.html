In short, and in my opinion, they have created the reference platform for Android tablet development. Pair that with the Galaxy Nexus phone and you have the best Android pair since the iPhone/iPad duo, for development.
But until I need to develop for Android, I&rsquo;m not going to buy one. I already have an iPad and an iPhone.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/on-the-nexus-7/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 28, 2012 8:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/someone-is-coming-to-eat-you/>Someone is coming to eat you</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Michael Lopp, for Rands in Repose, wrote Someone is Coming to Eat You, a brilliant article on success and competition, well worth reading.
Apple’s current biggest competitor is itself, and I think Steve Jobs learned this the hard way - from the sidelines. When he returned, one of his first hires was a gentlemen named Tim Cook, and while Tim Cook holds a degree in industrial engineering, he is not an engineer, a designer, or a poet.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/28/someone-is-coming-to-eat-you/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 22, 2012 12:13 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/22/compete-to-maintain/>Compete to maintain, Disrupt to succeed</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There is a huge difference between competing in a market and disrupting a market. When competing, a company tries to make a similar product in a given market segment, then competes against incumbent products on price or features to gain share and hopefully profits. When disrupting, a company produces a whole new product (or a viable derivative) that creates or changes a market, then dominates share and profits in that segment.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/22/compete-to-maintain/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 20, 2012 7:07 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/non-upgradable-smartphones/>Non-upgradable Smartphones</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, Microsoft announced it&rsquo;s new Windows 8 smartphone platform, and it looks quite good. But they also announced that their recently released Windows 7.x phones cannot be upgraded to Windows 8. Which means all those early Metro interface adopters who purchased the brilliant Nokia Lumia smartphones are screwed until their lock-ins expire in two years time.
It&rsquo;s the same in the Android space, whether caused by manufacturers or carriers, they both seem to spend too much time blaming each other so in my book, they&rsquo;re both responsible.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/non-upgradable-smartphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 20, 2012 10:10 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/single-pay/>Single-pay, Ad-pay or Both-pay?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Author&rsquo;s note: This article makes no point, takes no stand and argues no single position. I wrote it to see if I could come to come conclusion on which of &lsquo;user-pay&rsquo; vs &lsquo;ad-pay&rsquo; vs &lsquo;both-pay&rsquo; makes sense, and failed. But published it anyway to see if it spurs others smarter than me to explain and solve this conundrum.
It used to be in the old days when news was delivered to your home in paper form that the only way to get coupons or know about a sale at Macy&rsquo;s was from the advertising in this newspaper.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/single-pay/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 20, 2012 8:57 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/learn-to-automate/>Learn to Automate</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It&rsquo;s been almost six months since the Codecademy launched learn to code in 2012, headlined by Mayor Bloomberg. Lots of people pledged, lots signed up.
And I&rsquo;ll be flabbergasted if any of them are still doing it.
I&rsquo;m not going to go into why having everybody learn to code is a bad thing in detail, Jeff Attwood nails that in Please Don&rsquo;t Learn to Code. Short version, it puts the method before the problem, programmers like to solve problems and create solutions, and the tool they mostly use is code.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/20/learn-to-automate/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 18, 2012 1:31 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/18/markdown-metadata/>Markdown Metadata</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As you all know, I write everything in Markdown, see my The Markdown Mindset. It would be nice, though, to also save metadata - information about the document - in the document, to make it searchable, but not to have it appear in the final output.
Turns out, MultiMarkdown (and other new Markdown processors) do support this. It&rsquo;s easy.
Simply add the metadata to the top of a markdown file as follows:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/18/markdown-metadata/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 17, 2012 2:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/17/unrepairable/>Unrepairable</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Last week, Apple launched the new retina Macbook Pro. Which, of course, was immediately followed by a brouhaha (Definition: A noisy and overexcited critical response, display of interest, or trail of publicity.)
Kyle Wiens, who runs a web site called iFixit which creates videos for people who want to fix things, posted an article in Wired entitled The New MacBook Pro: Unfixable, Unhackable, Untenable claiming that the new laptop is unfixable by the general public, and that this is, of course, obviously &ldquo;a very bad thing&rdquo; and part of a trend that will destroy the tech industry as we know it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/17/unrepairable/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 17, 2012 1:21 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/17/the-care-and-feeding-of-software-engineers/>The care and feeding of software engineers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Nicholas C. Zakas (@slicknet), writing in NCZOnline in The care and feeding of software engineers (or, why engineers are grumpy), writes:
And here’s the real crux of the problem: software engineers aren’t builders. Software engineers are creators. Building is what you do when you buy a piece of furniture from Ikea and get it home.
