That clearly illustrates the difference between charging for our time and charging for our experience. Clients want cheap, quick fixes, but we sell solutions born from deep experience. The latter is worth more.

The Earth did not stop, or even pause as it continued its solitary journey.
Yet the baby grew up and made his own journey. Cape Town to Sydney to Tokyo to New York. Via Jerusalem, Johannesburg, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Nice, Geneva, Munich, Salzburg, Milan, Rome, Athens, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Singapore, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Saigon, Hanoi, Vientiane, Sapporo, Kobe, Nagano, Kuala Lumpur, Borneo, Berlin, Barcelona, Prague, Budapest, Vienna, Venice, Malta, Sicily and hundreds of places in between, all filled with wonder, sights, tastes, experiences and joys.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/20/45-revolutions/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 19, 2012 11:55 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/19/say-no-to-spec-work/>Say NO to Spec Work</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TL;DR: Spec work is delivering creative work for free to prospective clients, encouraged by a bunch of work-listing or contest-hosting services. Say NO, even if that means you have quiet times, or you’ll never become a professional.
One of the negative things about being an indie is that the consulting and project work comes in fits and starts, and there are times, like now, when we have no client work to do at all (so contact me).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/19/say-no-to-spec-work/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 19, 2012 10:27 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/19/why-windows-just-cant-win/>Why Windows Just Can’t Win</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Mat Honan, writing in Wired in Why Windows Just Can&rsquo;t Win, concludes:
It doesn’t matter if Microsoft creates the greatest operating system in the world if it then allows others to junk it up. And, ultimately, it means that Microsoft isn’t in control of its brand.
The Metro name, the crapware, and the horrible release dates all point to the same problem: Even when Microsoft has a great product on its hands, even when its product, engineering and design teams manage to hit one out of the park, it won’t matter once the business team comes in and ruins it for everyone.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/19/why-windows-just-cant-win/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 16, 2012 5:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/16/too-many-menu-bar-apps/>Too Many Menu Bar Apps?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>These days, in order to maximize my productivity, I seem to be running a lot of menu bar apps on my Macintosh OS X system. So many that I had to buy a menu bar manager, Bartender! Add what you use in the comments.
Here’s what each one is and why I use it (in no particular order):

The open versus closed ecosystem holy war is in full force, with a lot of words written in absolute and extreme terms. Yet the so-called walled garden systems appear to be most popular and most successful.
I believe that in reality these closed ecosystems actually have very permeable walls and that we&rsquo;re really working in the middle ground between open and closed.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/15/walled-gardens-are-permeable/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 14, 2012 11:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/14/the-post-pc-future/>The Post-PC future, iCloud turns one</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Apple&rsquo;s iCloud service turned 1-year old on October 12, 2012. The day passed with a whimper in a tech press focussed on irrelevant issues such scratching, purple flares, maps and other Apple so-called &ldquo;failures&rdquo;.
I think it&rsquo;s a big deal, because with iCloud, Apple may finally be getting internet services right and the post-PC era just got real for most people. And no-one seems to have noticed.
As an early adopter, though, post-PC started early for me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/14/the-post-pc-future/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 13, 2012 12:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/13/fixing-open-with-in-os-x/>Fixing Open With in OS X</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If you use the Open With&mldr; contextual menu on OS X (right-click on a file in Finder), you may find a lot of applications get duplicated or are just plain wrong.

So much noise that Apple is trying to “fix” the problem by not shipping pre-scratched ones, and by telling people that scratching is normal for aluminium products.
I prefer Remy Labesque’s take back in 2011 in Aged to Perfection, the back of scratched iPhones can and does look beautiful.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/scratched-iphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 10:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/>Spent more on Patents than R&D?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Ian Betteridge @ianbetteridge takes the New York Times down in Did Apple and Google really spend more on patents than R&D?, in response to the NYT article The iEconomy: Apple and Technology Manufacturing (Subscription required):
Read the NYT piece, and you would think that the technology market has shifted from being about research and development of new products to being about acquisition of patents. Given that this is based on a single year, when some very big patent portfolios came on the market in one-off deals that aren’t likely to be repeated in the future, that’s a long way from the truth.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/31/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/29/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
