So much noise that Apple is trying to “fix” the problem by not shipping pre-scratched ones, and by telling people that scratching is normal for aluminium products.
I prefer Remy Labesque’s take back in 2011 in Aged to Perfection, the back of scratched iPhones can and does look beautiful.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/scratched-iphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 10:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/>Spent more on Patents than R&D?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Ian Betteridge @ianbetteridge takes the New York Times down in Did Apple and Google really spend more on patents than R&D?, in response to the NYT article The iEconomy: Apple and Technology Manufacturing (Subscription required):
Read the NYT piece, and you would think that the technology market has shifted from being about research and development of new products to being about acquisition of patents. Given that this is based on a single year, when some very big patent portfolios came on the market in one-off deals that aren’t likely to be repeated in the future, that’s a long way from the truth.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/spent-more-on-patents-than-r/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 9:56 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/microsoft-lost-its-mojo/>Microsoft Lost its Mojo</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Another well written article today in Vanity Faire, How Microsoft Lost Its Mojo: Steve Ballmer and Corporate America’s Most Spectacular Decline, which visits Microsoft’s lost decade and current structural problems. Well worth Instapering (Is that a word?).
Ballmer’s key business philosophy for Microsoft was so antiquated as to be irrelevant. The Microsoft C.E.O. used to proclaim that it would not be first to be cool, but would be first to profit—in other words, it would be the first to make money by selling its own version of new technologies.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/microsoft-lost-its-mojo/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 10, 2012 9:48 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/bbedit-still-rules/>BBEdit still Rules</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Lovely article on how the stalwart classic BBEdit still rules by Andy Ihnatko (@ihnatko) on Macworld today, entitled Mac classics: Why BBEdit rules
“BBEdit’s still important because at its essential core, it’s a tool for working with text,” says Rich Siegel, Bare Bones Software’s founder and CEO. “Not text for presentation, as in a word processor or page-layout application, but rather text as data supplied to other software: code for compilers and interpreters, markup and Web applications for Web browsers, log files and data tables for analysis, and for any tool that inhales raw text and turns it into something else.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/10/bbedit-still-rules/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 8, 2012 7:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/08/stop-with-the-old-text-editors-already/>Stop with the old Text Editors already</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few years, it has become a thing to stop using IDE’s and modern text editors in favor of Vim. I understand older programmers using Vim out of habit, but the new generation of programmers? I don’t get it. Every-time I write about text editors, this growing group tweets to give modern GUI editors up and switch to old trusty rusty crusty terminal-based Vim.
Stop it! I’m not going to do that.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/08/stop-with-the-old-text-editors-already/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 8, 2012 3:19 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/08/hiltmonism-minimize-the-glue/>Hiltmonism - Minimize the Glue</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Glue is bad. Too much glue and your systems and processes become rigid, inflexible and incomprehensible. In technology and in business, you need to minimize the glue.
Let’s start with a few definitions. Lets call a potential interconnection between two systems a path. An interface is code to import or export data from an application. Now we can define an integration as a process whereby data is pulled from one interface, travels down a path and is loaded into another interface.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/08/hiltmonism-minimize-the-glue/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 29, 2012 3:57 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/29/export-to-excel-is-a-red-flag/>Export to Excel is a Red Flag</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As a developer, I often get requests from clients asking me if I could deliver them a spreadsheet using their data from their systems that contains X and Y and Z.

It made some notes of the experience, then decided to wait until I returned home to see what I remembered about the experience.
The tablet itself was larger than the iPad, a lot thicker, a lot heavier and had a lot more ports. It also came with a stylus and a keyboard dock which was useful in turning it into a laptop when needed.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/windows-8-preview-on-a-tablet/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 27, 2012 3:29 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/bye-bye-skitch/>Bye bye Skitch, Hello LittleSnapper</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Editor&rsquo;s Note: Written six months ago, I&rsquo;ve since moved on to using Glui - a better Skitch to replace Skitch.
Bye bye Skitch I’ve been using Skitch to grab screenshots since the first beta was announced way back in June, 2007. I paid for Skitch Plus in February 2011 because I loved the product, and the work by Plasq, so much. Then Evernote purchased Skitch and I hoped that they would not mess it up.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/bye-bye-skitch/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/31/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/29/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) is CTO of an up and coming Hedge Fund, who loves to craft brilliant and delightful web, iPhone, iPad and Macintosh software products.
