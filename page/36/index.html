I am also lazy, so I like to use short macros instead of typing in the same thing over and over again. I used to use bash aliases or functions, but I mostly use TextExpander snippets now because I like to be sure they don&rsquo;t conflict with internal UNIX commands.

When I started Noverse two years ago as a professional software design and development company, I knew I would be competing against younger, cheaper programmers and masses of very cheap outsourced programmers.
A lot has happened over the past two years, and this article is about my own observations regarding the nature of this competition and how things have worked out for a lot of people I have spoken with who have chosen cheap.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/14/cheap-programmers-cost-more-and-ship-less/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 12, 2012 3:56 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/12/kifu-v1-dot-0-released/>Kifu v1.0 Released</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Noverse LLC (my company) and the The Shukai Company LLC, is very pleased to announce that Kifu v1.0.0 has shipped. And our first customers are already happily using Kifu in production. We want to thank all our beta testers and beta clients for testing Kifu and helping us make such a great product.
Kifu is an intuitive, easy-to-use software product for small non-profits and community organizations to easily manage their community and its events.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/12/kifu-v1-dot-0-released/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2012 11:16 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/building-and-dismantling-the-windows-advantage/>Building and dismantling the Windows advantage</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Horace Dediu, of the excellent Asymco blog, presents some interesting Mac vs PC stats in Building and dismantling the Windows advantage.
Take a look, then come back, I&rsquo;ll wait.
In 1984, Windows was outselling Mac at 6 to 1. In 2004, it was an incredible 56 to 1. Microsoft was killing it. Microsoft had won.
But then Apple turned around. By 2010, the number had dropped to 20 to 1, still strongly in Microsoft&rsquo;s favor, unless you add iPhone and iPad into the mix.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/building-and-dismantling-the-windows-advantage/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2012 11:01 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/great-since-day-one/>Great since day one</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment nails it in Great since day one:
I never make technology-buying decisions based on future promises, rumors, or potential.
and
I buy things that are great today. They’re usually things that have been great since day one. And, more often than not, they’re Apple products.
I agree with Marco, I buy what I need now, so I can be productive now.
I do not understand how folks can put up with the frustration with what they have, the inability to get things done or the doing without by waiting for something that may never happen.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/great-since-day-one/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2012 10:58 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/the-unreasonable-man/>The unreasonable man</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

Most Mac, iOS and Web applications have large numbers of small image files that are used everywhere. They need to be sliced up, scaled and exported into the files and formats needed by the application. Exporting multiple art items in multiple resolutions has been a tedious and time consuming task, a task that had to be repeated manually every time the artwork changed.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/slicy-photoshop-artwork/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 6, 2012 11:51 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/06/target-the-forward-fringe/>Target the Forward Fringe</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Daniel Jalkut, writing on his Red-Sweater blog in Target The Forward Fringe nails who our target market truly is, in discussing whether to retina-ize (HiDPI) our websites and applications.
Because HiDPI customers may be a fringe group, but they are a forward-facing fringe. They represent the users of the future, and the more we cater to them now, the more deeply embedded our products and designs will be in their culture.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/06/target-the-forward-fringe/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 5, 2012 11:11 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/05/carriers-are-the-biggest-threat-to-innovation/>Carriers are the biggest threat to innovation</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Nilay Patel, writing for The Verge gets it in Five years after the iPhone, carriers are the biggest threat to innovation. Extremely clear and well written, too many awesome quotes.
Getting a device on a major carrier can take up to 15 months and cost millions of dollars; carriers are notorious for demanding custom devices in order to create customer lock-in. &ldquo;Exclusivity is the bane of my existence,&rdquo; says one source at a major phone manufacturer.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/05/carriers-are-the-biggest-threat-to-innovation/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 30, 2012 12:32 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/30/project-folder-layout/>Project Folder Layout</a></h1><p class=summary-body>We all work on multiple projects. And we&rsquo;re creating new ones all the time, whether for new engagements, new personal projects or spikes. I personally like to have all my project files properly organized, every component of the project has its place, so I have been using my own standard project folder layout for years.
Until now. The old one was no longer working.
So I rearranged my standard project folder layout.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/30/project-folder-layout/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/37/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/35/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
