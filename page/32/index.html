Here’s hoping TextMate 2 gets it’s game on. But at least I have it working closer to the way I want it to work and look now. Here are the minor changes I have made to make it work for me and how it compares to TextMate 2 (Updated: See My TextMate 2 Setup - The Hiltmon).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/14/my-sublime-text-2-setup/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 13, 2012 3:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/13/choosing-sunglasses/>Choosing Sunglasses</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Two weeks ago I went kayaking on Long Island sound, and lost my sunglasses. Once again, my friends, it was time to research the next pair.
My criteria for sunglasses may differ from yours, they are:
Good lenses: I program for a living, and need my eyes to remain in top condition for as long as possible. Cheap lenses increase eye strain for me, which is bad for my work and mood.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/13/choosing-sunglasses/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 13, 2012 12:56 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/13/app-dot-net-funded/>App.Net Funded</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, App.Net got funded. Not many of us expected that to happen, but it did, and we’re happy to pay our $50 or $100 to kick it off. Most reports are reporting this service as a paid Twitter clone, and yes, that’s part of it. But the goals are bigger:
You are not the product: The product in Twitter is you, because it’s free. On App.Net, you are paying for the ID and the service and the access.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/13/app-dot-net-funded/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 9, 2012 11:07 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/09/textmate-2-is-now-open-source/>Textmate 2 is now Open Source</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My favorite programmers editor of all time, TextMate, recently updated to TextMate 2 Alpha. I’ve been using the alpha for a while, still love it, but it&rsquo;s an alpha release and therefore buggy and slow. So I’ve been trying out Sublime Text 2 as a replacement. So far, I switch between TextMate 2 Alpha and Sublime Text 2 daily, only because closing the last tab in TextMate 2 closes the darn project editor and that annoys me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/09/textmate-2-is-now-open-source/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 8, 2012 11:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/08/expect-the-unexpected/>Expect the Unexpected</a></h1><p class=summary-body>There was a panic at one of my client sites today when the reporting software I wrote for them stopped working. Instead of presenting reports as usual, the software threw an unknown error.
WTF, an unknown error!
I wrote the darn system, I know all the errors, because I coded all of them!
A quick glance at the logs indicated that indeed, Passenger was throwing an unknown error when accessing one Rails URL (and all others were working just fine).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/08/expect-the-unexpected/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 7, 2012 12:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/07/well-managed-scripts-better-than-platforms/>Well Managed Scripts better than Platforms</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the most misunderstood things in computing is the need and power of scripts. Most IT shops seek out platforms, tools and technologies to perform business functions, when a bunch of well architected and documented scripts is all that is really needed.
script /noun/
An automated series of instructions carried out in a specific order written in an interpreted computer language
Over the years, I have seen many organizations go out and buy very expensive platforms and hardware, and hire very expensive staff, without even once looking at the alternative, well managed scripts.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/07/well-managed-scripts-better-than-platforms/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 6, 2012 2:16 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/06/no-competition-in-carrier-space/>No competition in Carrier space</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If you are looking for more proof that there is no real competition in the US mobile carrier space, check out BGR’s iPhone: Data caps, upgrade fees blamed on iPhone by AT&T, Verizon by Brad Reed:

Most of us do not update our operating systems or toolkits while a project is ongoing. It increases the time to produce the product, adds risk that things will stop working, it’s just not worth doing. But once the project is over, it’s time to update the tools and study new ones.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/06/mischief-managed-update-tools/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 6, 2012 12:12 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/06/mischief-managed-archiving/>Mischief Managed: Archiving</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Mischief Managed is a series of posts on tasks and technologies I use to maintain my computing environment.

When a project or engagement is completed, support is over, and you’re on to the next thing (or taking a break), it’s best to move these files and tasks out of your current folders and into archive folders.

I’ve been planning on doing this for ages, but no excuses, you should too.
And then this happened. Last week, Mat Honan got hacked hard (see Yes, I was hacked. Hard.).
