I happened to click on a Mike Zornek (@zorn) link today and noticed that he is still running iPulse on his desktop. I used to run it back in the early days of OS X on my Titanium Powerbook.
Back then, I had already returned to the Mac. But in 2003 or so, OS X was still very buggy and slow.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/11/natsukashii-ipulse-sighting/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 10, 2013 4:06 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/10/top-pages-in-status-board/>Top Pages in Status Board</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Google has finally deprecated their GAPI interface which this used to talk to Google Analytics, sorry folks, it will no longer work.

The peaks are high and the troughs are low.
When an indie is busy, there is nothing better, no higher high. They are working with great clients, creating amazing products, solving the unsolvable, slaying dragons and earning enough money to pay the bills.
But when an indie is quiet, there is nothing worse, no lower low. No clients to please, no products to create, no problems to solve, no dragons to slay and no income coming in.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/08/is-this-the-end/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 5, 2013 10:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/05/sharing-nvalt-notes-with-ulysses-iii/>Sharing nvAlt Notes with Ulysses III</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I&rsquo;m testing out Ulysses III for writing and so far I am finding it postively interesting for a 1.0 rewrite.

Here&rsquo;s how to share notes between Ulysses III and nvAlt.
In Ulysses III, click the plus icon on the bottom left (1) and choose Add External Source... (2). Choose the folder in Dropbox where you store your nvAlt plain text notes, then click Open.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/05/sharing-nvalt-notes-with-ulysses-iii/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 4, 2013 11:30 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/04/go-home/>Go Home</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I was talking with a friend the other night about their number one concern with their new job, in that they expect to have to work until 11PM every night and would therefore give up yoga, movies and dating.

WTF! NO! Go Home! You work to live, not live to work.

In parallel, and unbeknownst to me, Christian Tietze was doing the same thing, just paying for it (See Sales and AppLaunch.us experience for Calendar Paste, worth a read and reminding me to post this).
The results are:
12 PR messages sent (see the actual message sent at the bottom of this post) 1 delivery failure (so I used a backup address) 2 robo-responders indicating that the emails were received, thank you 0 reviews 0 posts about the product 0 requests for promo codes 0 responses 0 sales To be clear, I do not blame any of these folks for the lack of response (and I did not really expect any).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/direct-marketing-your-app-to-tip-lines/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 28, 2013 11:55 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/60-million-to-aquihire-me/>$60 million to aquihire me</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So this week, Yahoo paid $30 million to acquire Summly and it&rsquo;s 17 year old founder Nick D&rsquo;Aloisio (just Google it).
The way I read the deal:
Summly and its product is going to be shut down. So it&rsquo;s not the product they wanted. Nick only has to hang around for 18 months to get all his money. So it&rsquo;s not the founder they wanted. Summly licensed its technology from someone else, so Yahoo is not getting any IP in the deal either.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/60-million-to-aquihire-me/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 26, 2013 10:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/26/oldest-trace-of-you-on-the-internet/>Oldest Trace of You on the Internet</a></h1><p class=summary-body>For a lark, and in response to this tweet:
