One thing I wanted to try was to use it for notes alongside nvAlt.
Here&rsquo;s how to share notes between Ulysses III and nvAlt.
In Ulysses III, click the plus icon on the bottom left (1) and choose Add External Source... (2). Choose the folder in Dropbox where you store your nvAlt plain text notes, then click Open.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/05/sharing-nvalt-notes-with-ulysses-iii/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 4, 2013 11:30 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/04/go-home/>Go Home</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I was talking with a friend the other night about their number one concern with their new job, in that they expect to have to work until 11PM every night and would therefore give up yoga, movies and dating. I almost dropped my drink (which is a horrifying thought for an Aussie).
WTF! NO! Go Home! You work to live, not live to work.
I was that person, the one who worked all hours.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/04/go-home/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 28, 2013 12:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/direct-marketing-your-app-to-tip-lines/>Direct Marketing your App to Tip Lines</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In TimeToCall - After One Month, I stated that my next marketing experiment would be to send a PR style email to popular press site tip lines to see if they worked. In parallel, and unbeknownst to me, Christian Tietze was doing the same thing, just paying for it (See Sales and AppLaunch.us experience for Calendar Paste, worth a read and reminding me to post this).
The results are:
12 PR messages sent (see the actual message sent at the bottom of this post) 1 delivery failure (so I used a backup address) 2 robo-responders indicating that the emails were received, thank you 0 reviews 0 posts about the product 0 requests for promo codes 0 responses 0 sales To be clear, I do not blame any of these folks for the lack of response (and I did not really expect any).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/direct-marketing-your-app-to-tip-lines/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 28, 2013 11:55 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/60-million-to-aquihire-me/>$60 million to aquihire me</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So this week, Yahoo paid $30 million to acquire Summly and it&rsquo;s 17 year old founder Nick D&rsquo;Aloisio (just Google it).
The way I read the deal:
Summly and its product is going to be shut down. So it&rsquo;s not the product they wanted. Nick only has to hang around for 18 months to get all his money. So it&rsquo;s not the founder they wanted. Summly licensed its technology from someone else, so Yahoo is not getting any IP in the deal either.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/28/60-million-to-aquihire-me/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 26, 2013 10:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/26/oldest-trace-of-you-on-the-internet/>Oldest Trace of You on the Internet</a></h1><p class=summary-body>For a lark, and in response to this tweet:

The other must have not-so-secret weapon for iOS art is Bjango&rsquo;s iOS and Android Photoshop Actions & Workflows. These are a set of Photoshop actions that speed up the creation and scaling of iOS artwork.

Realize that you will never have an information advantage over the pros. Most information is geared to short term results anyway. Just don’t pay attention to short term news and rumours when it comes to investing. It won’t help you. Buy a stock for your own reasons and sell when those reasons are no longer true. This will stop you from making emotional decisions and trading on rumours.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/19/long-on-apple/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/19/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/17/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
