I no longer want hiltmon.com to be one of those collection points.
I&rsquo;m going to miss the comments though. Your comments had been insightful, gracious and a wonderful way to connect with my readers, and to allow my readers to connect with each other.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2018/06/17/on-removing-comments/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 17, 2018 9:21 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2018/06/17/stop-and-think/>Stop and Think</a></h1><p class=summary-body>When I started out as a developer and designer, I know I was clever. When folks asked me to design and develop a software product, I would ask a few questions to confirm that I understood what was asked of me, listen to their answers, then set about making the product. Request, build, ship. Easy!
My mentor, who was definitely smarter than me, used to yell at me to Stop and Think.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2018/06/17/stop-and-think/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 31, 2017 7:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/08/31/migrate-octopress-slash-jekyll-posts-to-ulysses/>Migrate Octopress / Jekyll Posts to Ulysses</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I wanted to move my published writing stashed in my Octopress/Jekyll site into my current writing workflow environment, Ulysses. Dragging and dropping the files from the _posts folder was not an option, because:
The file names were messy There is no title in the file, it&rsquo;s in the Markdown metadata I wanted to keep the publication date on the imported files So, I wrote a horrible script to do it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/08/31/migrate-octopress-slash-jekyll-posts-to-ulysses/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 12, 2017 12:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/03/12/notification-city/>Notification City</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It is best for your technology stack to tell you what went wrong as soon as it goes wrong to get the right level of attention in the correct timespan.
I run a massive technology stack at work, filled up with multiple servers, plenty of web applications, loads of C++ programs and massive numbers of scheduled and recurring tasks, and I do it with an insanely tiny team and no DevOps folks.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/03/12/notification-city/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 5, 2017 12:25 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/03/05/coding-style-standards-in-2017/>Coding Style Standards in 2017</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I&rsquo;ve been writing software for well over 30 years, I&rsquo;ve spent well over my 10,000 hours and gotten rather good at it. And I still write to a very rigorous coding style standard.
You&rsquo;re kidding right? Its 2017, code style guides are so passé.
Nope. I&rsquo;m deadly serious.
Get off my lawn Some of us remember when coding styles were de rigeur. When you climbed off your commuter dinosaur and joined a coding team, the first document they gave you was the coding style guideline.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/03/05/coding-style-standards-in-2017/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 28, 2017 2:39 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/01/28/mathjax-in-markdown/>MathJax in Markdown</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Adding mathematical formulae to HTML pages is easy these days using MathJax. But I create all my documents in Markdown format on my Mac. This post shows how to add mathematical formulae to your Markdown documents on the Mac and have them preview and export to PDF correctly.
MathJax in Markdown Adding mathematical formulae to a markdown document simply requires you to use the MathJax delimiters to start and end each formula as follows:</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2017/01/28/mathjax-in-markdown/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Nov 6, 2016 11:20 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/11/06/on-the-new-macbook-pros/>On the New MacBook Pros</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Much has been written, tweeted and complained about the new MacBook Pros released by Apple last week. Complaints about the 16GB limit, all-in switch to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), the removal of the SD-card and MagSafe, the new keyboard, the aged CPUs, the slow GPU, dongles, that they are not &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; level machines, and more.

A package that neither I nor my wife had ordered. A mysterious, enigmatic package. From the outside, there was no indication of its content or providence.
We discussed where it could have come from. What could it be. Should we open it. Maybe Amazon sent the package to the wrong person. Yet the delivery address was certainly mine.
Finally, I opened it.
It contained a bubble wrapped box, a bunch of packing bubbles and three slips of paper.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/10/07/the-gentleman-james-v/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Sep 25, 2016 2:10 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/09/25/the-annual-dependency-library-upgrade-process/>The Annual Dependency Library Upgrade Process</a></h1><p class=summary-body>At work, we write a lot of code. In order to remain productive, we reuse the same proven dependent libraries and tools over and over again. Which is fine. Until we start seeing end-of-life notices, vulnerabilities, deprecations, performance improvements and bug-fixes passing us by. At some point we need to update our dependencies for performance and security.
But its not that easy.
Take some of the libraries we use:
Google’s Protocol Buffers are amazing.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/09/25/the-annual-dependency-library-upgrade-process/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Aug 28, 2016 12:53 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/08/28/minimal-project-management-6-months-later/>Minimal Project Management - 6 Months Later</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Just short of six months ago, I wrote about how I was transitioning to Minimal Project Management as my team was growing at work. So, how did it go? Did it work? Any Problems?
In short, after a few false-starts getting our heads around the intent of the Statement of Work document, it went — and continues to go — very well.
