Data like project specific contacts (who to call for what for a given project); IP&rsquo;s, logins and passwords (for servers, VPN&rsquo;s, specific applications, client LAN&rsquo;s); and account information (hosting, third party vendors and project specific subscriptions).
I have finally nailed a way to do this that works just great for me and my markdown flow (See The Markdown Mindset).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/27/project-specific-data/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 26, 2012 2:56 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/26/the-missing-feature-fallacy/>The Missing Feature Fallacy</a></h1><p class=summary-body>If I had a dollar for every time a potential customer told me that they would buy my product if it just had this one missing feature, I&rsquo;d have enough to pay rent, in a penthouse, in New York, with a view, for a year.
The assertion is that the customer would buy the product if I would implement the specified missing feature. The counterpoint assertion is that the customer perceives the product as useless without this missing feature, and the product becomes useful only because of the missing feature.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/26/the-missing-feature-fallacy/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 25, 2012 4:14 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/25/old-farts-know-how-to-code/>Old Farts Know How to Code</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Nick Bradbury nails it in Old Farts Know How to Code:
&ldquo;Old farts&rdquo; are often excluded from that (Ed: startup) culture, not because we&rsquo;re lousy coders but because we won&rsquo;t put up with that shit. We have lives, we have families, we have other things that are important to us. We&rsquo;re not about to sleep at our desks and trade watching our kids grow up for the promise of striking it rich.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/25/old-farts-know-how-to-code/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 25, 2012 4:11 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/25/please-learn-to-write/>Please Learn to Write</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Michael Lopp, writing in Rands in Repose, counterpoints the current meme of &ldquo;Learning to Code&rdquo; in Please Learn to Write, great article. Love how he compares writing to programming:
Writing appears more forgiving because there is no compiler or interpreter catching your its/it’s issues or reminding you of the rules regarding that or which. Here’s the rub: there is a compiler and it’s fucking brutal. It’s your readers. Your readers are far more critical than the Python interpreter.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/25/please-learn-to-write/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 22, 2012 2:31 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/22/stylizing-my-services-agreement/>Stylizing my Services Agreement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I believe that everything that a person or company delivers to another should reflect their image, style, nature, professionalism and character. Which is why the look of the Noverse Professional Services Agreement drove me mad.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. My attorney and his team are absolutely brilliant. The contract content is the best, it&rsquo;s well written, well balanced, contains all the right terms and conditions for both sides, and my clients are all very happy to sign it as is.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/22/stylizing-my-services-agreement/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 22, 2012 9:39 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/22/distributed-note-taking/>Distributed Note Taking</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have switched over to and finally locked in on a new distributed note taking process, using Elements on the iPad, Dropbox synching, TextExpander file naming and nvAlt on the Mac. Here&rsquo;s how I got to this point, and how it works.
Going electronic, the old way Since I switched over to the iPad from a paper notepad about two years ago, I used Penultimate and a stylus to scribble notes.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/22/distributed-note-taking/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 18, 2012 12:52 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/zombie-email/>Zombie email</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So, I decided today to archive my old emails, and that meant connecting to the Google Apps holding pen for my last hedge fund which closed in 2009. This is a zombie email account I have not looked at in more than two years.
There were a lot of emails in it.
None of which I wanted or needed.
Surely by now, everyone knows that the company is gone and the email address is defunct.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/zombie-email/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 18, 2012 11:08 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/my-own-support-call-line/>My own support call line</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My ideal vendor support line is a direct number to call the exact person I need to speak to for support. Unfortunately, this is not economic for vendors, especially since I may never call this lucky, and quite bored, person for support.
My second worst vendor support line is the most common, a 1800 number that puts one in the queue, where you wait, listening to a robotic voice tell you how long you still need to wait, like a lump.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/my-own-support-call-line/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 16, 2012 4:26 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/apple-cinema-hd-display-circa-2003/>Apple Cinema HD Display circa 2003</a></h1><p class=summary-body>That&rsquo;s right kids, I am still using the old 23" Apple Cinema HD Display I purchased in 2003, 9 years ago, before Apple went all aluminium.
I use an ADB to DVI adapter to connect it to the Mac Pro. I love its matte screen, 1080p support and the fact that I have to prop it up using old Final Cut manuals.

Many of the files on my laptop are auto-managing, so as I am moving the process, I thought I&rsquo;d share how they are automatically managed using Hazel from NoodleSoft.
Hazel is a background process that monitors folders and executes automated actions on matched files. Once a rule is created in Hazel, I can forget about what I have to do and Hazel takes care of things for me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/automatically-managed-files/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/40/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/38/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
