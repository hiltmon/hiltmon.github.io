But it&rsquo;s a trap. Almost all programmers and libraries require Python 2 when Python 3 is out and way better. Choosing to use an old language for new project traps us into supporting old languages, libraries and platforms. And that&rsquo;s not smart. The intent of this post is to point out this odd stagnation and encourage the migration and adoption of Python 3, or, as it has happened in the past, we&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere for a solution.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/01/04/python-its-a-trap/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 27, 2013 9:26 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/27/cant-innovate-anymore/>Can't innovate anymore, my ass</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few days I have seen so many references to the Quartz post 2013 was a lost year for tech that it has become a meme. &ldquo;Innovation is dead&rdquo;, &ldquo;2013 proves it&rdquo;, &ldquo;RIP Innovation&rdquo;, it screams.
Rubbish!
2013 was a great year for innovation in the tech space.
in·no·vate /ˈinəˌvāt/ verb
make changes in something established, esp. by introducing new methods, ideas, or products. Remember, innovation is not about creating something completely new (that&rsquo;s invention), it is about making changes to established products that significantly improve their abilities or experience.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/27/cant-innovate-anymore/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 25, 2013 12:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/25/writers-thank-you/>Writers: Thank You</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I want to say thank you to a bunch of writers, to people who do what they do because they love to do it, from an anonymous one that reads and appreciates what they do every day.

I hear this every day. Even now, in 2013, more than 20 years after hierarchical file systems became the core and the norm of computing, users still struggle to understand something as simple as knowing the location of their own files in their own computer systems.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/24/cannot-find-file/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 7, 2013 1:50 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/12/07/managing-multiple-projects-assembly-notes-in-one/>Managing Multiple Project's Assembly Notes in One</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The problem I have is that I regularly need to open a specific set of Markdown documents scattered all over my file system while I work and have them available at my fingertips.

So here are the basic parts of TextMate 2 that I use regularly.

I use OmniFocus to manage my personal tasks and activities, but my company uses Asana to manage Project tasks and activities amongst the team. I am so used to using OmniFocus that I often forget to check or update Asana, and thus miss tasks assigned to me or progress by the team.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the projects and tasks in Asana also appeared in OmniFocus?</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/11/03/merge-asana-projects-into-omnifocus/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Oct 23, 2013 9:41 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/10/23/apples-and-rotten-oranges/>Apples and Rotten Oranges</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So Frank Shaw, Corporate Vice President of Communications at Microsoft wrote a thing called Apples and Oranges in response to the Apple Laptop, iPad, iWork, iLife and Mac Pro event yesterday, and sadly, it got a lot of coverage.
