It&rsquo;s Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s birthday today and all his friends have taken the time to celebrate him and his works, including:

Enter rake isolate["x"] to isolate the site down to the selected post. But isolating requires me to note the file name down, there is too much to remember and type and I am lazy.
So have created two macros and a script to speed this process up.
Note: You must run these commands in the root of the Octopress folder, else they will not work at all!</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/18/octopress-post-and-publish/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 18, 2012 1:45 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/18/estimating-software-like-it-is/>Estimating Software like it is</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Software estimates are hard. Clients expect things to take little time (see It Should Only Take You a Few Hours&mldr;) and cost little money. But the reality is that software is hard, there is lots to do, lots of work over and above just programming and it takes a lot more time and money to make good product. Most people underestimate the work to be done, or try to make the estimates look good, so most projects run over time and over budget because of this.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/18/estimating-software-like-it-is/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 16, 2012 12:47 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/16/kinds-of-files-in-a-project-folder/>Kinds of Files in a Project Folder</a></h1><p class=summary-body>In preparation for a client call, I wrote a quick and dirty script to count the kinds of files in a project folder to show them what&rsquo;s involved. I wanted a nice presentation, and the files grouped into categories. I also added parameters to exclude certain folder patterns from the counter.
The command is
$ ~/Scripts/cfile.rb ~/Projects/Kifu/code/kifu log tmp doc versions The output is

I am also lazy, so I like to use short macros instead of typing in the same thing over and over again. I used to use bash aliases or functions, but I mostly use TextExpander snippets now because I like to be sure they don&rsquo;t conflict with internal UNIX commands.

When I started Noverse two years ago as a professional software design and development company, I knew I would be competing against younger, cheaper programmers and masses of very cheap outsourced programmers.
A lot has happened over the past two years, and this article is about my own observations regarding the nature of this competition and how things have worked out for a lot of people I have spoken with who have chosen cheap.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/14/cheap-programmers-cost-more-and-ship-less/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 12, 2012 3:56 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/12/kifu-v1-dot-0-released/>Kifu v1.0 Released</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Noverse LLC (my company) and the The Shukai Company LLC, is very pleased to announce that Kifu v1.0.0 has shipped.

Kifu is an intuitive, easy-to-use software product for small non-profits and community organizations to easily manage their community and its events.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/12/kifu-v1-dot-0-released/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2012 11:16 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/building-and-dismantling-the-windows-advantage/>Building and dismantling the Windows advantage</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Horace Dediu, of the excellent Asymco blog, presents some interesting Mac vs PC stats in Building and dismantling the Windows advantage.
Take a look, then come back, I&rsquo;ll wait.
In 1984, Windows was outselling Mac at 6 to 1. In 2004, it was an incredible 56 to 1. Microsoft was killing it. Microsoft had won.
But then Apple turned around. By 2010, the number had dropped to 20 to 1, still strongly in Microsoft&rsquo;s favor, unless you add iPhone and iPad into the mix.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/building-and-dismantling-the-windows-advantage/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2012 11:01 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/great-since-day-one/>Great since day one</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Marco Arment nails it in Great since day one:
I never make technology-buying decisions based on future promises, rumors, or potential.
and
I buy things that are great today. They’re usually things that have been great since day one. And, more often than not, they’re Apple products.
I agree with Marco, I buy what I need now, so I can be productive now.
I do not understand how folks can put up with the frustration with what they have, the inability to get things done or the doing without by waiting for something that may never happen.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/great-since-day-one/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2012 10:58 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/the-unreasonable-man/>The unreasonable man</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
