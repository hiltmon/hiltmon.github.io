A lightweight snap, annotate and save to PNG or share the image app. And I think Glui may be it.
I just wanted an app that just does the following like the original Skitch betas:
Snap Quick Annotate Save as image, or Share the image Go away Glui, by Sebastian Razola (@razola), does exactly that.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/20/glui-a-better-skitch/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 15, 2013 12:38 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/15/criticmarkup-bundle-for-textmate-2/>CriticMarkup Bundle for TextMate 2</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Update: Christian Tietze (@DivineDominion) has created a bundle that&rsquo;s included in the official toolkit, so I contributed my bundle&rsquo;s commands to that, and will be using and contributing to that one from now on.

Recently, @macdrifter and @themindfulbit announced CriticMarkup, a way for authors and editors to track changes to documents in plain text.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/15/criticmarkup-bundle-for-textmate-2/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 14, 2013 1:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/14/common-misconceptions-about-the-app-store/>Common Misconceptions about the App Store</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Over the past few days, new and old friends have been popping up to mention they purchased TimeToCall and were surprised that I did not know that they had done so.
It turns out that this is but one of several misconceptions about the Apple App Store. So let me clarify some for you:
TL;DR
No access to buyer’s information No access to reviews No Trials and Upgrades We do not get buyers information from the Apple When you purchase an app from the App Store, Apple handles all the licensing, payment and download for us.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/14/common-misconceptions-about-the-app-store/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 14, 2013 7:56 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/14/timetocall-after-one-week/>TimeToCall - After One Week</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TimeToCall is a simple, universal iOS application I developed to help people choose the best time to call when calling internationally.

I’m already loving the hot-key profiles to launch uniquely colored remote sessions, the split panes, and the brilliant hotkey window (useful to run a single command and get rid of it).
But there are a few things that needed some work. Some of the usual Mac editing keys did not work, I got rid of a few annoyances and added a few lovely preferences, and I needed the ability to create a new terminal window on the current space as part of my being productive with virtual desktops flow (Just like Browser Windows on All Desktops).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/13/make-iterm-2-more-mac-like/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 10, 2013 2:38 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/10/download-dreamhost-server-logs/>Download Dreamhost Server Logs</a></h1><p class=summary-body>This site is hosted on Dreamhost, and I could not be happier with them. But some time ago, the engineers there decided to disable FTP access to the server logs. No reason given.
If you have a Dreamhost shared account, try it. ftp into your server using your favorite FTP client, click the logs folder, then your site folder, then http and you’ll get an error. This is because the http folder is actually a symlink to a private, readonly folder on the server that is inaccessible to FTP.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/10/download-dreamhost-server-logs/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 10, 2013 1:57 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/10/add-web-clip-icons-to-octopress/>Add Web Clip Icons to Octopress</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The default Octopress setup includes a favicon.png which enables you to place your own tiny icon to the left of the URL in most browsers. You should see a small blue cog there now.
Both Apple and Android phones also support saving a link to a site (called a web clip) on your phone as an icon. Over the past few days, it seems quite a few viewers of this site have added it as a web clip, but I had not provided good iconage.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/10/add-web-clip-icons-to-octopress/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 7, 2013 8:18 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/07/timetocall-shipping/>TimeToCall - Shipping</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TimeToCall is a simple, universal iOS application I developed to help people choose the best time to call when calling internationally.
