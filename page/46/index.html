As of right now, my first two iPhone App Store apps, Emergency List and Sights to See are no longer available for sale, anywhere. I have taken them down.
These apps were developed two years ago, for old versions of the iPhone, and no longer represent the best we can do. We were learning iOS at the time, did not have access to the right designers and did the best we could back then.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/13/taking-down-my-old-iphone-apps/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 11, 2012 9:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/11/hiltmonism-fix-instead-of-blame/>Fix instead of Blame</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I was saving this one up for later, but events of this week prompted me to write it now.
Whenever something goes wrong, the first reaction of many people is to find someone else to blame. Arguments and vitriol erupt, things are said or smashed, as each team member tries to protect themselves from being blamed.
I, for one, do not ever again want to be on a team that does this.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/11/hiltmonism-fix-instead-of-blame/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 7, 2012 9:19 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/07/speculative-developers/>Speculative Developers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I totally agree with the sentiment in David Sparks&rsquo;s note Speculative Developers where he compares developers who &lsquo;barf&rsquo; out volumes of bad apps versus developers who lovingly craft a single great app.
They are, however, completely wrong. Their chance of hitting it big with two (or twenty) crappy apps instead of one good one is about the same as their chance of retiring with their lotto winnings. Infinitesimally small.
If you want to develop apps, take your time and make something awesome.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/07/speculative-developers/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 7, 2012 8:58 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/07/design-needs-an-advocate/>Design needs an Advocate</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Felicity Evans, writing in the Smashing Magazine article When A Thousand Words Is Worth A Picture writes:
Design is itself a process of deduction. It involves a number of decisions, both conscious and unconscious. During this process, the designer dismisses some ideas as unworkable and pursues others in order to arrive at a solution.
But this process is completely opaque to the client. The client likely views the design not as the outcome of an in-depth process, but as a response to the brief, merely a visual representation of the constraints and considerations set before the designer.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/07/design-needs-an-advocate/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 7, 2012 8:54 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/07/structure-first-content-always/>Structure First.

Let’s stop siloing content, shall we? We did it for a while when we were designing a largely brochureware, templated web. Now, we’re trying to move that silo from one end of the process to the other. Let’s focus on structure to begin with, and think about content all the time. There is a symbiotic relationship between content and design. One cannot thrive without the other.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/07/structure-first-content-always/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 3, 2012 10:26 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/your-idea-sucks/>Your idea sucks, now go do it anyway</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Lovely article by Jason Cohen, worth a read, called Your idea sucks, now go do it anyway makes a great point on how the original idea for something usually evolves into something completely different, and success comes from embracing that evolution.

Do workers in Foxconn factories who build products for Apple, Dell, HP, and others, work long hours at tedious tasks? Yes they do. Do they work for a fraction of what a worker in the US, Japan, or even Korea would? Yes they do.
Are they being enslaved? Clearly, they are not.
I suspect that a lot of the heat from the recent press comes from a lack of understanding about Chinese culture, their rapid change from manual agrarian life to high-tech manufacturing, and the significant differences and scales of our economies.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/cheap-iphones/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 3, 2012 10:12 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/news-logic/>News Logic</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Paddy Harrington, writing in Wanna Figure Out If Your Product Is Any Good? Think Like A News Editor
At its heart, news logic is about value creation and the primacy of the design output instead of a story that traditionally gets applied after the fact. Where in the old days (i.e., five years ago), you designed something and then told a story about it in the hopes that it was a story worth telling, more and more of tomorrow’s design projects will have a story worth telling built into their hearts right from the get-go.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/03/news-logic/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/47/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/45/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
