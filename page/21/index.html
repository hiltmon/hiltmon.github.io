I am hoping v1.0.1 gets approved soon so you can all play with time.
Why make a Video? There is no trial on the App Store, so the next best thing is a quick video to help people decide whether the App does what they want.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/05/timetocall-demo-video/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 2, 2013 12:27 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/02/better/>Better?</a></h1><p class=summary-body>We all seem to spend a lot of time looking for better things, writing about them and arguing that our choices are better than others&rsquo; choices of things. These jeans are better than those jeans, this laptop is better that that laptop, this app is better than that app, this coffee is better than that one.
We&rsquo;re all wrong, what is better for one is not better for all, because we all have different utility functions.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/02/better/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 28, 2013 5:57 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/28/timetocall-first-updates-coming-soon/>TimeToCall - First Updates Coming Soon</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I&rsquo;ve received some great feedback and a few bug reports on TimeToCall and spent some time trying to make it a better product. The next decision is when to pull the trigger and put the first update through the App Store review process.
Changes The two big changes I have made so far are a more accurate slider and the time now toggle.
In the original release, I set the time slider to jump to 15 minute increments to make it easier to hit a &lsquo;zero&rsquo; time.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/28/timetocall-first-updates-coming-soon/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 27, 2013 12:46 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/27/have-a-better-agenda/>Have a Better Agenda</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Many, many years ago I went on one of those corporate week-long training courses to learn how to negotiate. Back then I was too young and too green to learn anything from it except I remember this mantra:
The only way to win against someone with an agenda is to have a better agenda.
At the time, I never quite understood what that meant. I think I have a better handle on it now.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/27/have-a-better-agenda/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 26, 2013 11:48 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/26/buyreply-email-text-tweet-to-buy/>BuyReply: Email, Text, Tweet, Click to Buy</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Prior to online purchases, the only innovation in purchasing was credit cards. The move to online electronic purchasing has seen only one more real innovation, 1-click by Amazon. The current online purchasing experience really just replicates the same onerous manual purchasing process that’s been around since money was invented.
Until now.
With BuyReply, purchasing is as far away as an email, text or tweet. Completely frictionless. Completely effortless. Available everywhere.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/26/buyreply-email-text-tweet-to-buy/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 26, 2013 8:47 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/26/using-twitter-adn-and-xpost/>Using Twitter ADN and #xpost</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I think I have finally figured out how I want to use App.Net and Twitter . Given my low follower counts on both, and the different follower groups I have on each, I should get away with it.
TL;DR: Follow me on both, no more cross-posting anything except blog post announcements, mute #xpost on one service to prevent duplicates. (Really? A TL;DR here! For an article this short?

Not anymore (the Oscars were on).
Announcing the first release of my TextMate 2 bundle and a separate command line tool for retrieving, creating and updating GitHub Gists.
The main difference between this and other implementations is that this one caches gist mappings (gist id to file names in ~/.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/25/gist-textmate-bundle-and-command/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 22, 2013 6:02 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/02/22/multiple-themes-in-textmate-2/>Multiple Themes in TextMate 2</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One thing I like to do is to have different themes for different file types in my text editor. That way, at a glance, I can guess what kind of file a text-filled window contains, especially when zoomed out using Mission Control.

A lightweight snap, annotate and save to PNG or share the image app. And I think Glui may be it.
I just wanted an app that just does the following like the original Skitch betas:
