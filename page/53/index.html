Seek the Criticism on Quora. Just read it. It&rsquo;s short.
Two productive things can come out of a meeting with a VC:
They help you directly. Money or connections.
They make you better. They criticize you where it counts. They poke holes. They make you defend. They make you justify. They make you question.
Seek the criticism, because accolades don&rsquo;t help you.</p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 13, 2011 10:48 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/dont-give-up-on-your-techs/>Don't give up on your techs</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My good friend, Brad Lindenberg, writing in The diminishing value of technical founders in startups talks about the value of the super technical people needed to perform the heavy lifting at the beginning of a startup.

The stages in the Usage Lifecycle of a product are:
• Unaware This isn’t so much a stage as it is a starting point. Most people are in this stage: completely unaware of your product.
• Interested These people are interested in your product, but are not yet users. They have lots of questions about how it works and what value it provides.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/13/the-usage-lifecycle/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 12, 2011 9:28 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/12/the-lost-art-of-the-print-statement/>The lost art of the print statement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Debugging software is hard, especially if you were not the original author. All programming languages come with debugging tools, from the arcane GDB to the dead sexy step-through debuggers in Xcode and Visual Studio.

&mldr;it comes with your Amazon account information preloaded, along with &ldquo;1-Click&rdquo; ordering. That means anyone who is holding that device can place an order, whether it&rsquo;s their account or not.
My question is whether this behavior is by design or by accident.

Most systems and spreadsheets try to present everything to their users, reams and reams of raw unfettered data. And most users, if you ask them, both want the data and hate the data volume that they have to deal with. Looking closer at the situation, the reason they want the raw data is because they believe they can use the data to get answers to their questions, or use the data to do their jobs.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/hiltmonism-information-not-data/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 6:49 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/dont-be-a-free-user/>Don't be a free user</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Maciej Ceglowski, writing on the Pinboard blog in Don&rsquo;t Be A Free User calling it as it is.
Someone builds a cool, free product, it gets popular, and that popularity attracts a buyer. The new owner shuts the product down and the founders issue a glowing press release about how excited they are about synergies going forward. They are never heard from again.
His point is valid. All the businesses he refers to started as a free service, had no business model, got sold and died.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/dont-be-a-free-user/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 6, 2011 9:42 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/good-news-online-retailers-do-not-hate-their-customers/>Good news - online retailers do not hate their customers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Sarah Perez gets it completely wrong writing in a Techcrunch article entitled Retailers Aren’t Ready For iPad Shopping Trend
Now for the bad news. Despite the increases in tablet traffic, many retailers are not prepared to accommodate these new mobile shoppers. Compuware also prepared a chart showing the top retailers’ sites, and whether or not they offered an iPad-optimized website. Surprisingly, none of them do, not even Apple.com. What’s worse, Apple is also among the retailers who don’t offer a native iPad application.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/06/good-news-online-retailers-do-not-hate-their-customers/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 4, 2011 11:43 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/12/04/zittrain-misses-the-point/>Zittrain misses the point</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Via slashdot, directly quoted:
