In short: I write all my work documents, including letters, reports and software documentation in Markdown formatted text files and then format them using Marked and a standard stylesheet (See Letterhead - Markdown Style for how that works).</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/05/05/melding-scrivener-and-marked/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 27, 2014 12:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/04/27/the-markdown-payoff/>The Markdown Payoff</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I switched to Markdown format for documents, notes and other scratchings. (And wrote about it - see the posts in the Markdown category).
Was switching to Markdown a good call? Did it pay off? And if so, how?
I actually wrote this post not knowing how it would turn out. I wanted to know for myself if it paid off, or if I just followed a fad.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/04/27/the-markdown-payoff/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 19, 2014 12:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/04/19/keep-long-running-unix-commands-alive/>Keep long running UNIX commands alive</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Here&rsquo;s the situation: you have a UNIX script that takes a long time to run, but gets killed when your computer goes to sleep and the SSH terminal or VPN disconnects. Ouch.
I know of three ways to kick long running scripts off and not worry about sleeping computers or disconnections: nohup, disown or tmux.
Simple: nohup From the man page:
nohup -- invoke a utility immune to hangups Which really does not tell the story.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/04/19/keep-long-running-unix-commands-alive/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 2, 2014 7:23 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/04/02/social-network-precedents-for-connecting-and-friending/>Social Network Precedents for Connecting and Friending</a></h1><p class=summary-body>As are we all, I too am active on a bunch of social networks. But I too do not connect or friend everyone on every network. I think we all want some semblance of control as to what we share and with whom we share it.

But over the past year, I have been using it less and less, getting less and less tracked and done, and it&rsquo;s all my fault.
You see, I started to experiment with what could be done with OmniFocus and messed up the whole concept of actually getting things done.
My primary experiment was to create scripts to automatically load actions in from my project files and to merge the company-wide Asana.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/29/rebooting-omnifocus/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 29, 2014 10:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/29/its-that-process-that-is-the-magic/>It's that process that is the magic</a></h1><p class=summary-body>CRINGLY: What&rsquo;s important to you in the development of a product?
JOBS: One of the things that really hurt Apple was after I left, John Sculley got a very serious disease.
It&rsquo;s the disease &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen other people get it too &ndash; it&rsquo;s the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work.
And if you just tell all these other people, you know, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this great idea,&rdquo; then of course they can go off and make it happen.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/29/its-that-process-that-is-the-magic/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 27, 2014 8:43 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/27/using-os-x-tools-to-build-a-linux-only-product/>How I use OS X Tools to build a Linux-only Product</a></h1><p class=summary-body>OS X really is a developer&rsquo;s dream platform, a solid UNIX core on which almost everything compiles with a brilliant graphical environment hosting the most amazing developer tools.
It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; in the above sentence that has recently tripped me up.
I have a new vendor library that does not compile or run on OS X (yet!). As this is a big project which I will be working on for months, I want to set up my development environment so that I am comfortable and productive.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/27/using-os-x-tools-to-build-a-linux-only-product/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 20, 2014 12:21 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/20/open-source-compiles-in-an-xcode-5-world/>Open Source Compiles in an Xcode 5.1 World</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So today I needed to work on an older, open-source based C++ application on my Mac and there was no way to compile it under Xcode 5 even though the development tools were installed and working perfectly.
The issue, it seems, is that Xcode 5.1 has finally removed and deprecated a lot of old C++ stuff that is still required by older, popular libraries such as boost and quickfix. It emulates g++ 4.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/20/open-source-compiles-in-an-xcode-5-world/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 15, 2014 1:12 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/15/develop-locally/>Develop Locally, Stage Nearby, Production Anywhere</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the things that surprised me as I moved back into the land of corporate software is the number of developers I talk to that commute and work in offices and yet develop on remote computers. I thought, as you probably do, that by now all software development would be local, as in on the developer&rsquo;s own computer.
Instead, it is not uncommon for corporate developers to rely on remote shells or desktop virtualization to access remote development computers and use them to code.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/15/develop-locally/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 2, 2014 10:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/02/from-tool-maker-to-tool-user/>From Tool Maker to Tool User</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Abstract: Programming is still seen as a single-language, single-platform tool-maker role. That has not been true for a long time. Over the years, the platforms, tools and libraries available have multiplied. We&rsquo;re tool users now, where a programmer can pick up a new platform with ease, and use the tools available to create complex, reliable products a lot quicker. That which was impossible then is commonplace now.
The role of the programmer has changed over the years, from being a certified single language, single platform tool-maker into a master of application styles, technologies, use cases and platform tool-users.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/02/from-tool-maker-to-tool-user/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/10/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/8/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
