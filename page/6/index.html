I love what the folks at DuckDuckGo are doing and want to spread the word.
DuckDuckGo is my search engine of choice (and is the page that opens in all new Safari tabs for me). If you are not using it as your default search engine, I&rsquo;d advise you to start now.
I started using DuckDuckGo well over two years ago. My initial impressions back then was that it was slow, the results were not nearly as good as Google&rsquo;s and the name was stupid.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/06/27/duckduckgo/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 27, 2015 2:33 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/06/27/a-simple-markdown-spotlight-importer/>A simple Markdown Spotlight importer</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Note: This is for Yosemite or before, for El Capitan or later, see A Yosemite Markdown Spotlight Importer.
I noticed recently that Spotlight on Yosemite was no longer indexing my Markdown files. Since all my notes are in Markdown format, and Spotlight is how I find my notes, this was a big problem. Reinstalling my current set of Markdown editors did not help.
This did. Huge thanks to Gereon Sommer for the idea in Mac OS X Spotlight Enhancement.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/06/27/a-simple-markdown-spotlight-importer/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jun 7, 2015 7:47 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/06/07/new-google-analytics-for-status-board-server-edition/>New Google Analytics for Status Board Server Edition</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Last week, Google finally deprecated their non-Oauth APIs, which means that the Google Analytics for Status Board code I have been publishing stopped working.

For those who do not know the 80/20 rule, it&rsquo;s a variant of the misnamed Pareto Principal wherein Vilfredo Pareto created a mathematical formula in 1906 to describe the unequal distribution of wealth in his country, observing that 20% of the people owned 80% of the wealth.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/05/29/that-last-effin-20-percent/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 17, 2015 3:28 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/05/17/rust-hits-1-dot-0/>Rust hits 1.0</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Rust is a project I have been observing for a while now, an attempt to create a new, fast, safe, systems programming language to replace C++, but with better memory safety and a bullet-proof concurrency model.

But I love using my current keyboards now.
Background: I was very happy with the Apple &ldquo;chicklet&rdquo; style keyboards and even wrote about it in Not the Clicky Keyboard. There I declared that clicky keyboards were not for me.
I was wrong. But I did not know it at the time.
A while back, my boss went on a buying bender and purchased a whole bunch of different keyboards, including the DAS and some Microsoft ones.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/03/08/the-perfect-keyboards-for-me/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 7, 2015 5:37 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/03/07/one-key-format-presets-in-scrivener/>One-Key Format Presets in Scrivener</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I am writing a lot of business documents in Scrivener, and even though it&rsquo;s the wrong way to do it, I use Scrivener&rsquo;s format presets (think paragraph styles) to quickly format headings, bulleted lists and paragraphs in each sub-document. This way I minimize post-processing (and the business format is intentionally boring so I do not need any fancy layouts).
But it&rsquo;s a hassle to have to take my hands off the keyboard to click through the Format / Apply Formatting / Apply Preset menu tree or hit the tiny format preset dropdown Â¶a to set the current paragraph style.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/03/07/one-key-format-presets-in-scrivener/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 1, 2015 6:18 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/03/01/merge-asana-projects-into-omnifocus-updated/>Merge Asana Projects into OmniFocus (Updated)</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I wrote a script to import Asana tasks into Omnifocus. If you ran it again, it would update the tasks in OmniFocus. See Merge Asana Projects Into OmniFocus.
I recently updated the script to work a smidge better with Asana and Omnifocus 2. The main changes are:
