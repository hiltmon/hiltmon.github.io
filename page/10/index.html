The issue, it seems, is that Xcode 5.1 has finally removed and deprecated a lot of old C++ stuff that is still required by older, popular libraries such as boost and quickfix. It emulates g++ 4.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/20/open-source-compiles-in-an-xcode-5-world/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 15, 2014 1:12 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/15/develop-locally/>Develop Locally, Stage Nearby, Production Anywhere</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the things that surprised me as I moved back into the land of corporate software is the number of developers I talk to that commute and work in offices and yet develop on remote computers. I thought, as you probably do, that by now all software development would be local, as in on the developer&rsquo;s own computer.
Instead, it is not uncommon for corporate developers to rely on remote shells or desktop virtualization to access remote development computers and use them to code.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/15/develop-locally/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Mar 2, 2014 10:04 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/02/from-tool-maker-to-tool-user/>From Tool Maker to Tool User</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Abstract: Programming is still seen as a single-language, single-platform tool-maker role. That has not been true for a long time. Over the years, the platforms, tools and libraries available have multiplied. We&rsquo;re tool users now, where a programmer can pick up a new platform with ease, and use the tools available to create complex, reliable products a lot quicker. That which was impossible then is commonplace now.
The role of the programmer has changed over the years, from being a certified single language, single platform tool-maker into a master of application styles, technologies, use cases and platform tool-users.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/03/02/from-tool-maker-to-tool-user/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 22, 2014 2:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/22/easy-ssh-to-local-linux-vm/>Easy SSH to local linux VM</a></h1><p class=summary-body>TL;DR: Run avahi on the VM, ssh to the VM name dot local.
Many of the Simple C++ Projects I work on, whether I use Xcode or not, land up needing to be recompiled on a Linux Virtual Machine prior to being deployed to the production Linux server. I do this because I want to be sure the I know what needs to be set up in the Linux environment, that the compile succeeds without errors in a production-like environment and the code works properly before deploying.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/22/easy-ssh-to-local-linux-vm/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 17, 2014 11:53 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/17/choose-not-to-be-anonymous/>I Choose not to be Anonymous</a></h1><p class=summary-body>A simple premise.

Yep, I&rsquo;m chilling and writing a blog post while replacing the entire data scaffolding of my firm as if it were just another cold Saturday. Magical indeed.
TL;DR: Rails migrations and Capistrano deploys create a stable, reliable, testable, reversible and no-fault way to manage and execute production database changes, no matter the platform size or complexity.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/08/magical-migrations/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 4, 2014 8:01 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/04/view-on-an-insider-as-ceo-for-microsoft/>View on an Insider as CEO for Microsoft</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Today, Microsoft announced Satya Nadella as its new CEO, a 22-year veteran of the business and a true Insider. I wish him the best of luck and success. But is choosing an Insider as CEO good for a mature Microsoft or bad?
I think its a bad call based on documented history of other mature companies and my own selfish (and very positive) wishes for the firm.
