Here&rsquo;s how I got to this point, and how it works.
Going electronic, the old way Since I switched over to the iPad from a paper notepad about two years ago, I used Penultimate and a stylus to scribble notes.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/22/distributed-note-taking/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 18, 2012 12:52 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/zombie-email/>Zombie email</a></h1><p class=summary-body>So, I decided today to archive my old emails, and that meant connecting to the Google Apps holding pen for my last hedge fund which closed in 2009. This is a zombie email account I have not looked at in more than two years.
There were a lot of emails in it.
None of which I wanted or needed.
Surely by now, everyone knows that the company is gone and the email address is defunct.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/zombie-email/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 18, 2012 11:08 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/my-own-support-call-line/>My own support call line</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My ideal vendor support line is a direct number to call the exact person I need to speak to for support. Unfortunately, this is not economic for vendors, especially since I may never call this lucky, and quite bored, person for support.
My second worst vendor support line is the most common, a 1800 number that puts one in the queue, where you wait, listening to a robotic voice tell you how long you still need to wait, like a lump.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/18/my-own-support-call-line/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 16, 2012 4:26 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/apple-cinema-hd-display-circa-2003/>Apple Cinema HD Display circa 2003</a></h1><p class=summary-body>That&rsquo;s right kids, I am still using the old 23" Apple Cinema HD Display I purchased in 2003, 9 years ago, before Apple went all aluminium.
I use an ADB to DVI adapter to connect it to the Mac Pro. I love its matte screen, 1080p support and the fact that I have to prop it up using old Final Cut manuals. It still works great, though.</p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 16, 2012 4:02 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/automatically-managed-files/>Automatically Managed Files</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I&rsquo;m moving back to the desktop for a while to do some iOS programming. Many of the files on my laptop are auto-managing, so as I am moving the process, I thought I&rsquo;d share how they are automatically managed using Hazel from NoodleSoft.
Hazel is a background process that monitors folders and executes automated actions on matched files. Once a rule is created in Hazel, I can forget about what I have to do and Hazel takes care of things for me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/automatically-managed-files/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 16, 2012 2:08 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/us-aircraft-embarcation-etiquette-failures/>US Aircraft Embarkation Etiquette Failures</a></h1><p class=summary-body><p>I just returned from a European vacation which involved flying in several aircraft from a wide variety of airports. Over the past few years, I have flown throughout the USA on local carriers and there are many things about the local embarcation experience that leaves a lot to be desired. Here are some of my annoyances, with proposed solutions as usual.</p></p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/16/us-aircraft-embarcation-etiquette-failures/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>May 15, 2012 10:46 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/15/recent-travels-and-tech/>Recent Travels and Tech</a></h1><p class=summary-body>My wife and I have been on vacation the past two weeks, the real vacation kind where you go to exotic places and are too busy seeing, trying, doing, eating and drinking things to keep up with email, tweets and blogging. We travelled to three European destinations with four iPhones, two iPads, a MacBook Pro and two plug adapter sets. Here&rsquo;s how they performed.
The MacBook Pro I brought the laptop along &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; I needed to jump in and fix any software issues while away.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/15/recent-travels-and-tech/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 26, 2012 9:49 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/application-context-packs/>Application Context Packs</a></h1><p class=summary-body>When developing in Rails, I use a certain pack of applications; when coding for iOS, I use a different pack of applications; and when in a blogging context, I use a third pack of applications. And then there is the regular set of applications that I usually leave running. Starting and switching between these contexts used to take time, until I found a better way.
The Old Way
After a clean reboot, I would then have to go through the same dance every time, launch the regular applications manually.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/application-context-packs/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 26, 2012 9:22 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/my-iphone-home-screen/>My iPhone Home Screen</a></h1><p class=summary-body>I have noticed of late a trend in people or sites showing off their iPhone home screens, the first page on your iPhone with the dock, and explaining why they rearranged the applications and icons. Some have even moved the Phone.app off their home screens.
They are all doing it, so it must be cool.
My home screen on the iPhone is factory original. All the applications are exactly in the same place that Apple put them when the iPhone was first set up.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/my-iphone-home-screen/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Apr 25, 2012 1:00 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/25/why-scope-creep-is-your-fault/>Why Scope Creep is your fault</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Christopher Butler writes in Why Scope Creep Is Your Fault (And What You Can Do To Prevent It):
Scope creep is like slowly loading up your plate with little portions of everything on the buffet until you realize man, this plate is getting heavy and omigod I can&rsquo;t eat all of this, what was I thinking!
In essence, it&rsquo;s just as much how we manage our clients as how we manage our work.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/25/why-scope-creep-is-your-fault/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/41/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/39/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>Twitter</a> &#183;
