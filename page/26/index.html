But if you are already in a Terminal session, you need to leave the keyboard, mouse to Finder and drag and drop the path back. Here’s a trick that gets you to the frontmost Finder path without leaving the Terminal or keyboard.

There are many wrong ways to do this, and I have seen all of them in practice:
Duplicate the existing class, rename it and add the flexibility to the new class. This sounds great as existing code remains unaffected, but sucks if a bug is found in the original and both need to be maintained.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/19/how-to-flexify-a-class/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 19, 2012 1:09 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/19/instagram-ad-image/>Free Instagram Ad Image for Advertisers</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Dear Instagram,

Six months ago, it was Twitter, and six months before that it was Facebook. Quitting over privacy.
Except they didn’t quit. They are all still on Twitter and Facebook and will remain on Instagram, because we, their friends are still there and the service remains awesomely useful.
If you are worried about privacy, but wish to remain on these services, just depersonalize.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/18/depersonalize-because-you-cant-quit/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 17, 2012 4:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/17/youre-the-advertisement/>You’re the Advertisement</a></h1><p class=summary-body>It used to be said that:
If you pay for a product, you’re a customer. If you don’t, you’re the product.
Now its getting worse. The new Instagram Terms of Use make you the advertisement for any unknown third party product. Anyone can pay Instagram to use your user name, your image, and your photos to advertise their product to anyone else, without your knowledge or consent.
Some or all of the Service may be supported by advertising revenue.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/17/youre-the-advertisement/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 16, 2012 10:06 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/16/gun-control-does-work/>Gun Control does Work</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Personal note: I have lived in the USA for 9 years now, and think this place is magnificent. Two days ago, in Newtown CT, 20 children and 6 adults were massacred. The dark side of America that is in denial about gun violence, that refuses to even discuss gun control, that treats massacres as a normal and regular part of life, a country that gives up its civil rights over a single terrorist act, but takes no action on a score of massacres of its children, well, that just scares the shit out of me.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/16/gun-control-does-work/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 11, 2012 5:03 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/11/de-fault-with-default/>De Fault with Default</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The word default has many meanings:
To a geek means the value set for a preference by the developer, as in “the default value for the web server port is 80”. To a finance person means the failure to fulfill an obligation, like pay off a security, as in “the company’s corporate bond is in default”. To a sports person means the failure of a team to arrive in time to participate in a sports match, thereby losing the match, as in “Qatar lose the soccer game by default to Uzbekistan”.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/11/de-fault-with-default/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 11, 2012 1:52 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/11/on-customer-and-developer-entitlements/>On Customer and Developer Entitlements</a></h1><p class=summary-body>en·ti·tle·ment /enˈtītlmənt/ Noun
The fact of having a right to something, or the amount to which a person has a right.
There has been a huge amount written this year about software pricing, availability and support, especially in light of the “race to the bottom” pricing and lack of trials and upgrade pricing in the Apple App Stores. Developers feel they are entitled to more money and respect for the effort they put in, customers feel entitled to free upgrades, multiple platforms and cheaper prices.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/11/on-customer-and-developer-entitlements/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 5, 2012 9:36 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/05/forced-arbitration-and-the-right-to-sue/>Forced Arbitration and the Right to Sue</a></h1><p class=summary-body>One of the things that is bothering me these days is the number of vendors changing their contracts unilaterally to require us to use their own arbitration and giving up our right to sue. You can ‘opt out’ of this change, where ‘opt out’ means they will immediately terminate service. The mobile carriers in the USA have had these for a while, as have the credit card companies and many employers.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/05/forced-arbitration-and-the-right-to-sue/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/27/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li><li class=page-right><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/25/>Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> (<a href=https://twitter.com/hiltmon>@hiltmon</a>) an independent software consultant, architect, designer and developer at <a href=https://noverse.com>Noverse LLC</a> (his own small business).</p><p>For the past 22 years he has specialized in the architecture, design, development, operations and trading of bespoke comprehensive front-to-back, multi-asset, <em>automated and algorithmic</em> trading, portfolio management and asset management systems to enable and grow three asset managers.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.social/@hiltmon>Mastodon</a> &#183;
