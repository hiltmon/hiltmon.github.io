&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Short Form&lt;/strong>: A small amount of headings and text up to 1000 words&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Standard Format&lt;/strong>: The same standard structure or pattern of document repeated over and over again&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Yet even though its short form and standard format, it takes too much time and effort to produce these, so we developers conveniently &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; to create these valuable documents (or mess up structure of them).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have found &lt;em>my&lt;/em> way to optimize the creation of these so I can spin them up quickly, deliver the information needed correctly, send them out and get back to coding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code Review is not all about the Code</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2022/08/10/code-review-is-not-all-about-the-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 12:12:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2022/08/10/code-review-is-not-all-about-the-code/</guid><description>We all understand the benefits of the code review process in reducing the risk of software issues making it out into the wild, and in improving the skills of developers. Frequently though, the code review focusses wholly on the code and on an eyeball search for potential bugs and no more. There is a better way.
As developers, we read and write code all day, it&amp;rsquo;s our superpower and wholly inside our comfort zone.</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/archives/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:44:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/archives/</guid><description>2022-09-13 What Did I Create as an Asset Manager CTO&amp;nbsp; 2022-12-22 Optimizing Short Form Writing for Developers&amp;nbsp; 2022-12-10 Code Review is not all about the Code&amp;nbsp; 2020-11-07 Working from Home ... 88 Days Later&amp;nbsp; 2020-09-14 Working from Home ... here we go!&amp;nbsp; 2019-02-31 The Theater was Empty&amp;nbsp; 2019-11-16 An iPad and a Pencil&amp;nbsp; 2019-01-09 Testing C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;17 Projects in Xcode with XCTest&amp;nbsp; 2018-09-17 On Removing Comments&amp;nbsp; 2018-09-17 Stop and Think&amp;nbsp; 2017-07-31 Migrate Octopress / Jekyll Posts to Ulysses&amp;nbsp; 2017-12-12 Notification City&amp;nbsp; 2017-12-05 Coding Style Standards in 2017&amp;nbsp; 2017-02-28 MathJax in Markdown&amp;nbsp; 2016-11-06 On the New MacBook Pros&amp;nbsp; 2016-08-07 The Gentleman James V&amp;nbsp; 2016-02-25 The Annual Dependency Library Upgrade Process&amp;nbsp; 2016-12-28 Minimal Project Management - 6 Months Later&amp;nbsp; 2016-08-26 Attractive Multi-Line SQL Statements in C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;nbsp; 2016-10-24 Apple Watch - After 1 Year&amp;nbsp; 2016-11-10 Spotlight Only - Nine Months Later&amp;nbsp; 2016-08-08 Text Expansion using Keyboard Maestro (First Cut)&amp;nbsp; 2016-12-03 Apple at 40&amp;nbsp; 2016-08-25 Dependency Limited and Conflict Free C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;nbsp; 2016-08-14 Hiltmonism - Talk to Drivers, not Mechanics&amp;nbsp; 2016-05-05 Minimal Project Management&amp;nbsp; 2016-01-28 Build only what you need&amp;nbsp; 2016-05-31 Now in HTTPS&amp;nbsp; 2015-09-25 We&amp;#39;re better than this&amp;nbsp; 2015-01-22 Dangerware&amp;nbsp; 2015-12-17 A Yosemite Markdown Spotlight importer&amp;nbsp; 2015-07-02 Making and maintaining high resolution charts for Indesign CC&amp;nbsp; 2015-07-14 Brown M&amp;amp;Ms: A Quick Way to Determine Code Quality&amp;nbsp; 2015-01-04 Why I Subscribed to Apple Music&amp;nbsp; 2015-10-28 The Simple C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; Makefile - Executable Edition&amp;nbsp; 2015-02-20 Saturday Afternoons Watching Rugby Union&amp;nbsp; 2015-12-05 The &amp;#39;It has happened before, it will happen again.</description></item><item><title>Working from Home ... 88 Days Later</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/06/07/working-from-home-88-days-later/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 11:00:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/06/07/working-from-home-88-days-later/</guid><description>Follow on post to Working From Home &amp;hellip; Here We Go! written in March.
88 Days ago in New York we all started working from home. 88 Days ago we stopped commuting, sat down for the first time at our fledgeling home workspaces, launched our first Zoom or Slack meetings and started figuring out how best to do our jobs from there. 88 Days later, we&amp;rsquo;re still doing it and will be for the foreseeable future.</description></item><item><title>Working from Home ... here we go!</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/03/14/working-from-home-dot-dot-dot-here-we-go/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 09:57:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2020/03/14/working-from-home-dot-dot-dot-here-we-go/</guid><description>It’s been many years since I worked from home and much is different since I ran Noverse from here. First, my wife has taken over my workspace as hers, so the desk, good keyboard, mouse and monitor are her domain now. Secondly, it’s likely this is not a one-day disaster recovery test, so I need to find a way settle in instead of use the laptop on the dining table. And thirdly, Slack has changed the way we communicate internally, which makes it as easy to maintain contact as it does in our open plan office.</description></item><item><title>The Theater was Empty</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/12/31/the-theater-was-empty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:14:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/12/31/the-theater-was-empty/</guid><description>Johannesburg, 1977 It was a crisp, sunny Saturday morning and my grandmother was in town. As we always did when together, we went to the movies. The theater nearby was old, run down but comfortable and in walking distance. I&amp;rsquo;d go there later again many times on many Saturday mornings.
For the first time, though, I was more excited about the movie than I was about going with grandmother. I was about to turn 10.</description></item><item><title>An iPad and a Pencil</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/02/16/an-ipad-and-a-pencil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 11:36:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2019/02/16/an-ipad-and-a-pencil/</guid><description>In 2018, I switched to using an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil when not using my computer, replacing notebooks, scraps of paper, Post-It notes, and ink-leaking pens.

Nope. I&amp;rsquo;m deadly serious.

A package that neither I nor my wife had ordered. A mysterious, enigmatic package. From the outside, there was no indication of its content or providence.
We discussed where it could have come from. What could it be. Should we open it. Maybe Amazon sent the package to the wrong person. Yet the delivery address was certainly mine.
Finally, I opened it.
It contained a bubble wrapped box, a bunch of packing bubbles and three slips of paper.</description></item><item><title>The Annual Dependency Library Upgrade Process</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/09/25/the-annual-dependency-library-upgrade-process/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2016 14:10:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/09/25/the-annual-dependency-library-upgrade-process/</guid><description>At work, we write a lot of code. In order to remain productive, we reuse the same proven dependent libraries and tools over and over again. Which is fine. Until we start seeing end-of-life notices, vulnerabilities, deprecations, performance improvements and bug-fixes passing us by. At some point we need to update our dependencies for performance and security.
But its not that easy.

It may be a limited version one, but it is a flawlessly engineered timepiece that is conducive to small, yet significant, life hacks.

Do not use dependencies that have dependencies that you have to compile. Do not use libraries depended on by dependencies anywhere else. Solve your own problems and understand the solutions. Do not copy-paste from the web. Always write your own code where performance and maintenance is critical.</description></item><item><title>Hiltmonism - Talk to Drivers, not Mechanics</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/03/14/talk-to-drivers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 20:26:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/03/14/talk-to-drivers/</guid><description>How many people really know how their motor vehicle works, or even care to.

I had quickly assembled a simple class that triggers periodic function calls from a timer on to a single worker thread. I need this class to ensure that periodic functions get called regularly. Since each call is quick to run (takes under a second), only needs to run every few minutes and can happily be queued behind another quick function, the simple single worker model is perfectly fine for this task.</description></item><item><title>Now in HTTPS</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/01/31/now-in-https/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 17:05:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2016/01/31/now-in-https/</guid><description>My host, Dreamhost, is offering free web site certificates through Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, a new initative to make encrypted connections the default standard through the internet.

Dangerware is just ordinary software, but the way it comes into being creates the danger.
It starts with a basic prototype written in a hurry. This is quickly put into production to run the business. The prototype screws up repeatedly when faced with new scenarios. Resources are tasked to add (not update or correct) the prototype to deal with the latest screwup. This process repeats until the resource (or original business person) is tasked to a new project, or the cost of screwup is less than the cost of resources to mitigate.</description></item><item><title>A Yosemite Markdown Spotlight importer</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/11/17/a-yosemite-markdown-spotlight-importer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 12:26:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/11/17/a-yosemite-markdown-spotlight-importer/</guid><description>All my text and writing is in Markdown formatted files and I would like to search them using Spotlight.

In my case, my fund publishes several high quality books and one-pagers monthly and I need to update a bunch of charts and graphs. I also need to print these at a very high DPI, hence Indesign.
I used to use Adobe Illustrator graphs. They are rudimentary, but very customizable. Every month I had to load an Illustrator file for each image, update the graph data and then spend time tweaking the results.</description></item><item><title>Brown M&amp;Ms: A Quick Way to Determine Code Quality</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/10/14/brown-mms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 19:31:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2015/10/14/brown-mms/</guid><description>My business runs on code.

If you right-click in Xcode on a Makefile and Open with External Editor, OS X opens it in TextEdit. Which is worse.
The issue is that TextEdit is associated with extension-less files. Usually to change how files are opened, you select the file in Finder, right-click and choose Get Info from the menu.

Think about it as the regular tidying of your desk (or room) and filing things away &amp;ndash; versus the rearranging and rewiring of a full code refactor. You can get a lot more done on a tidy desk.
Quick code cleanups can and do include some minor refactoring, but they are mostly about renaming items, reformatting code and commenting on or cleaning up messy sections.</description></item><item><title>Aral on Spyware 2.0</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/08/22/aral-on-spyware-2-dot-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 08:05:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/08/22/aral-on-spyware-2-dot-0/</guid><description>That word is spyware.

And they all share a lot of common code.
The traditional approach to build and debug this pattern is to create a library of the common code in one project, a separate server project and another client project, then jump between windows to edit and compile where needed.
But I am often coding on my trusty 13&amp;quot; MacBook Air screen and it&amp;rsquo;s just too tiny to have all these Xcode windows open with their console windows visible.</description></item><item><title>WordCounter</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/14/wordcounter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 18:24:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/07/14/wordcounter/</guid><description>WordCounter by Christian Tietze (@ctietze) does one thing, and does it well:
It counts the number of words you type in registered applications and displays the total on the menu bar.
Most writers I know use several different software tools while writing, like nvAlt for notes, Byword for short pieces and Scrivener for the big things. But each of these has a separate word count (if at all).

That has not been true for a long time. Over the years, the platforms, tools and libraries available have multiplied. We&amp;rsquo;re tool users now, where a programmer can pick up a new platform with ease, and use the tools available to create complex, reliable products a lot quicker. That which was impossible then is commonplace now.
The role of the programmer has changed over the years, from being a certified single language, single platform tool-maker into a master of application styles, technologies, use cases and platform tool-users.</description></item><item><title>Easy SSH to local linux VM</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/22/easy-ssh-to-local-linux-vm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2014 14:03:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2014/02/22/easy-ssh-to-local-linux-vm/</guid><description>TL;DR: Run avahi on the VM, ssh to the VM name dot local.

Why would you buy it if you specifically want a Windows 8 tablet and a Samsung Activ goes for under $699.00 (and includes the keyboard).
And if you do add the keyboard for $120 (which pushes the price over $1,000) to use the Surface as a laptop, why not buy the best laptop ever made, the MacBook Air for $999.</description></item><item><title>Browser Windows on all Desktops</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/19/browser-windows-on-all-desktops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2013 14:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/19/browser-windows-on-all-desktops/</guid><description>In Being Productive With Virtual Desktops, I talked about how I pin certain applications to certain Mission Control virtual desktops to create context specific environments.

I tried BBEdit for programming, and it is good.

Release a very negative article on a stock, citing rumors and anonymous sources (none of which is verifiable). Wait for the stock price to drop because your readers trust your credibility. Buy loads of the stock cheaply at the new lower price. Wait for the next earnings report to prove you wrong (which you knew already). Profit. Despicable.

Duplicate the existing class, rename it and add the flexibility to the new class. This sounds great as existing code remains unaffected, but sucks if a bug is found in the original and both need to be maintained.</description></item><item><title>Free Instagram Ad Image for Advertisers</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/19/instagram-ad-image/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 13:09:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/12/19/instagram-ad-image/</guid><description>Dear Instagram,

If you truly dislike bullshit writing and don’t want to support it, hit the publishers where it hurts: don’t read it, and don’t link to it.
I only partially agree.

A 32GB Microsoft Surface RT has only 16GB free according to the Microsoft Surface FAQ. Thats 16GB for the Operating System! 5GB of that is recovery tools which could be on the net, but instead chews up expensive internal flash memory! This bloat explains the pricing and performance issues with the device. Arguably, you can expand the Surface (and Android devices) with up to 64GB more disk space using a single SD card, but that I/O is pretty slow compared to the built-in flash memory.</description></item><item><title>AAPL vs AMZN Performance Madness</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 13:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/05/aapl-vs-amzn-performance-madness/</guid><description>Philip Elmer-DeWitt noted something interesting on Saturday in Fortune magazine, Amazon&amp;rsquo;s price-to-earnings ratio is now 2,767. Apple&amp;rsquo;s is 13! In the last quarter, Apple&amp;rsquo;s earnings were up and the stock went down, whereas Amazon reported a loss and the stock went up.
When a company reports bumper earnings, I assume its stock price should rise, and when a company takes a loss, the stock price should fall. After all, the stock price is really the public valuation of the company.</description></item><item><title>Grand Central Today</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/29/grand-central-today/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 15:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/29/grand-central-today/</guid><description>Images courtesy MTAInfo.</description></item><item><title>Surface RT is not a Duck</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 16:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/surface-rt-is-not-a-duck/</guid><description>What is a duck? Well, if it looks like a duck, floats like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. The just-released Microsoft Surface RT fails the duck test, it looks like a tablet, but it is not a tablet. Windows 8 RT also fails the duck test, it looks like Windows 8, but it is not Windows 8.
For the record, I have used the real proper Windows 8 on a Samsung tablet before, so my impressions of the Surface and Windows RT are based on that experience.</description></item><item><title>Marco and the Surface</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 11:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/27/marco-and-the-surface/</guid><description>Marco Arment, of Instapaper and The Magazine fame, went to a Microsoft Store yesterday to try out the new Surface and wrote about the experience in his blog in An alternate universe.

I’m sad to say but I think I may have to agree with his conclusion:

I just wish that senders and responders on email would follow some basic etiquette rules that will make our use of email both more pleasant and more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Email is a form of communication which is a reflection of you. Bad email etiquette reflects badly on you, and a record of this is kept in mailboxes over which you have no control. Good email etiquette reflects well on you, improves your public perception and persona and increases the chance of a prompt and comprehensive response. It’s not hard to maintain good email etiquette once you know what it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing before we start, before creating or responding to an email, ask yourself this: is email the right medium for this communication? If you are not sure, pick up the phone or wander over to the person and have a conversation. Email only if it is the right medium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And always follow good etiquette. This article contains a comprehensive list of rules and recommendations learned through experience and research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Big 5 Windows 8 Lineups</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 09:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/the-big-5-windows-8-lineups/</guid><description>My thoughts on announced hardware for Windows 8 being released this week.

It doesn’t matter if Microsoft creates the greatest operating system in the world if it then allows others to junk it up. And, ultimately, it means that Microsoft isn’t in control of its brand.
The Metro name, the crapware, and the horrible release dates all point to the same problem: Even when Microsoft has a great product on its hands, even when its product, engineering and design teams manage to hit one out of the park, it won’t matter once the business team comes in and ruins it for everyone.</description></item><item><title>Too Many Menu Bar Apps?</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/16/too-many-menu-bar-apps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2012 17:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/16/too-many-menu-bar-apps/</guid><description>These days, in order to maximize my productivity, I seem to be running a lot of menu bar apps on my Macintosh OS X system.

The tablet itself was larger than the iPad, a lot thicker, a lot heavier and had a lot more ports. It also came with a stylus and a keyboard dock which was useful in turning it into a laptop when needed.</description></item><item><title>Bye bye Skitch, Hello LittleSnapper</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/bye-bye-skitch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 15:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/27/bye-bye-skitch/</guid><description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: Written six months ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve since moved on to using Glui - a better Skitch to replace Skitch.
Bye bye Skitch I’ve been using Skitch to grab screenshots since the first beta was announced way back in June, 2007. I paid for Skitch Plus in February 2011 because I loved the product, and the work by Plasq, so much. Then Evernote purchased Skitch and I hoped that they would not mess it up.</description></item><item><title>New iOS6 Cached Maps</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/24/new-ios6-cached-maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2012 16:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/09/24/new-ios6-cached-maps/</guid><description>One feature I do like about the new Maps in iOS 6, the vectors and data are now cached.

Getting There The restaurant is in Kanazawa city on the Japan Sea side of Japan, about 450 km north-west of Tokyo.

The age of selling software to users at a fixed, one-time price is coming to an end. It’s just not sustainable at the absurdly low prices users have come to expect.

And if you think that&amp;rsquo;s a problem for us, imagine how the developers feel.
Er, Sandboxing? Sandboxing is a computer security term for separating running programs so that they can only access a limited set of files and resources on your computer and not interfere with other programs and files.</description></item><item><title>My WWDC 2012 Predictions</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/09/my-wwdc-2012-predictions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jun 2012 14:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/09/my-wwdc-2012-predictions/</guid><description>After writing Annual Apple WWDC Disappointment, several people have asked me what I do expect at the WWDC 2012 keynote, ignoring the rumors.

There’s a massive disparity between data sucking smartphones and data plans offered by carriers. Customers know this, and the carriers are fully cognizant of it.

There are two types of schedule, which I&amp;rsquo;ll call the manager&amp;rsquo;s schedule and the maker&amp;rsquo;s schedule. The manager&amp;rsquo;s schedule is for bosses.

&lt;p>My take: We, especially businesses, need to keep all old emails under law in case of subpoena, just like individuals need to store tax records. We need all our old work files as they are referenced in later works. We need our music and photo files because we no longer have their physical equivalents (or have to buy them again and again in case of media).

Design is itself a process of deduction. It involves a number of decisions, both conscious and unconscious. During this process, the designer dismisses some ideas as unworkable and pursues others in order to arrive at a solution.
But this process is completely opaque to the client. The client likely views the design not as the outcome of an in-depth process, but as a response to the brief, merely a visual representation of the constraints and considerations set before the designer.</description></item><item><title>Structure First.

At its heart, news logic is about value creation and the primacy of the design output instead of a story that traditionally gets applied after the fact. Where in the old days (i.e., five years ago), you designed something and then told a story about it in the hopes that it was a story worth telling, more and more of tomorrow’s design projects will have a story worth telling built into their hearts right from the get-go.</description></item><item><title>The paradox of choice</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/the-paradox-of-choice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 10:41:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/the-paradox-of-choice/</guid><description>People desire more choices, yet are unable to choose when the selection is greater, that is the paradox of choice.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that has been used sporadically for decades. With this practice, a software engineer cycles minute-by-minute between writing failing unit tests and writing implementation code to pass those tests. Test-driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile software development methodologies.</description></item><item><title>Where the light is better</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/where-the-light-is-better/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2012 10:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/26/where-the-light-is-better/</guid><description>A woman comes across a man crawling under a street lamp. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my car keys,&amp;rdquo; he explains.

&lt;p>In the USA, when one walks into a restaurant to eat a hamburger, one has to endure a full interrogation. &lt;em>How would you like the burger cooked? Would you like cheese on it? What kind of cheese would you like? Would you also like bacon on it? Lettuce and tomato? Onions? Raw or Fried? Mayonnaise, ketchup, relish or mustard? Which kind of mustard? Do you want fries on the side? A pickle too? Sesame on the bun? Raw or toasted?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give us a break. We want a hamburger, make by a professional in the making of hamburgers, and presented to us as the best mix of ingredients prepared properly that they believe makes a great hamburger. We did not go in there to make choices, we went in to eat a delicious burger, pay and leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out software users want the same thing. Product, made by us, that satisfies their needs, without the options and choices and interrogations that make using it difficult, confusing and dissatisfying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You are not your Customer</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/24/you-are-not-your-customer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2011 12:41:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/24/you-are-not-your-customer/</guid><description>One of the most common memes in software development is that great products come from a programmer scratching an itch. They needed software to do something, did not like what was out there, and created a great product. They were their own customer, they knew what they wanted and they made the software for themselves.
As with most meme&amp;rsquo;s, this one is only somewhat true. They did have an itch. They did create some software.</description></item><item><title>F*ck You, Pay Me</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/23/f-star-ck-you-pay-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2011 18:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/23/f-star-ck-you-pay-me/</guid><description>For all you designers, programmers, indies and freelancers, I give you the best, most informative video, you will ever see.

They’re filled with ads and social-media sharing buttons — and more ads. And Google plus-onesies and Facebook likeys. And also more ads. Plus tweet-this-es. Plus ads. (And, under-the-hood, a whole cruise-ship-full of analytics. The page required well-more than 100 http calls.)
No wonder we all like InstaPaper and Safari&amp;rsquo;s Reader mode.

Recently, he reposted a link to an old post that I think all programmers should read. Go on, read it now. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
In it, he talks of the The Way of the Code Samurai, but really just points out the same topics I try to impress on all programmers I teach.
Think first Write all your code &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; the first time you write it Less source code is better Optimize only after you are done The only thing missing from my top 5 is the temporal issue</description></item><item><title>Four Keys to Apple's Success</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/22/four-keys-to-apples-success/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2011 23:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/22/four-keys-to-apples-success/</guid><description>Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of worldwide iPod, iPhone, and iOS product marketing, speaking at the “Silicon Valley Comes to Cambridge” event in the UK, shared what he believes to be the four keys to Apple’s success.
Focus &amp;ldquo;It means saying no, not saying yes. We do very few things at Apple. We are $100bn in revenue with very few products. There are only so many grade A players. If you spread yourself out over too many things, none of them will be great.</description></item><item><title>About the Hiltmon</title><link>https://hiltmon.com/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2011 20:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://hiltmon.com/about/</guid><description>My name is Hilton Lipschitz, but everybody calls me hiltmon.
