My name is **Hilton Lipschitz**, but everybody calls me **hiltmon**.

Recently, I was Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at my third awesome growing New York Financial Asset Manager, designing and building the most amazing trading technology ever. Before this, I was the designer, consultant,  programmer, and owner of [Noverse LLC](https://noverse.com), an independent iOS (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch), Macintosh (OS X) and Web (Ruby on Rails) product development company, based in New York, USA.

My background is varied: born in South Africa, bred in Australia, lived in Japan and now in New York.  I have been a programmer for over 32 years, a project manager on some large and complex projects in the 1990's and more recently, a CTO at three hedge funds.  Having been there and done that, I decided for a time to go indie, to consult, to make my own products and to help others make amazing brilliant software products.

I have released a whole bunch of free code, bundles and themes for developers to share, see my [code]({{< ref "code.md" >}}) page.

You can get in touch with me using any of the methods below.

Every article (and indeed almost everything I write) is crafted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
