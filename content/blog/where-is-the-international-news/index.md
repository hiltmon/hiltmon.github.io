Claire Belinski explains in the badly titled [How to Read Today's Unbelievably Bad News :: Gatestone Institute](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3294/how-to-read-today-unbelievably-bad-news) where good international news coverage has gone.

> Something has gone very wrong in American coverage of news from abroad. It is shoddy, lazy, riddled with mistakes, and excessively simplistic.

> Above all, it is absent.

Mainly this is why:

> In the event of a massive breaking story—such as the uprisings in Tahrir Square—the networks parachute their people in. They bone up on the story by reading the local English-language newspapers (and in any country where English isn't widely spoken, it is important to ask: Why does it have an English-language newspaper? The answer, usually, is that the paper is trying to sell a particular version of local events to investors and to English-speakers—a version, needless to say, that is not necessarily the whole truth).

Worth a read...
