On Twitter today:

All our attention is focussed on the race-to-the-bottom, in-app purchase rip-offs or the current fad app, *but we forget that software, well-built and well-maintained software, has no shelf life.*

**I *still* use [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) every day. It *still* doesn't suck!**

Kudos to Rich Siegel ([@siegel](https://twitter.com/siegel)) and his team at [BareBones](http://www.barebones.com) for consistently making such an amazing and useful application.

FYI: The long, stable history of BBEdit is on it's [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit).
