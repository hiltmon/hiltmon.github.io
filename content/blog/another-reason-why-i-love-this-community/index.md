Friendly competition, another reason to love this community.

The gang at [App.Net](http://alpha.app.net) just released their new integrated [stream marker](http://devblog.app.net/2012/11/12/new-api-feature-stream-marker/) feature.

The first response I see (at the top) is from Manton Reece (TW: [@manton](https://twitter.com/manton), ADN: [@manton](http://alpha.app.net/manton)), the maker of [Tweet Marker](http://tweetmarker.net) that competes with this feature, congratulating them on their implementation.
