<span class="light">Note: This is not an advertisement. I love what the folks at DuckDuckGo are doing and want to spread the word.</span>

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is my search engine of choice (and is the page that opens in all new Safari tabs for me). If you are not using it as your default search engine, I'd advise you to start now.

I started using [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) well over two years ago. My initial impressions *back then* was that it was slow, the results were not nearly as good as Google's and the name was stupid. **None of those first impressions turned out to be true.**

### Why [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)?

- **They do not track you**. It always feels creepy using Google Search because they know so much about me. In a post-Snowdon world, we know we're being tracked. One fewer tracking source a good start.
- **It's really fast**.
- **The results are the results you are looking for** and nothing else. No Ads. No Promoted Links. No "personalized search results". And none of those scumbag aggregation sites that serve copied content and ads.
- **No page breaks**, just scroll for more.
- **Their instant answers are great** and getting better.
- **They are adding new search features every day**. Just recently they added live MLB scores.
- **Bang commands** allow us to search specific sites. Just start with a `!`. Brilliant. Which means, at worst case, you can get to an encrypted *private* Google Search by starting with `g!` if the [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) search does not find what you are looking for.

### Making it the Default

In **OS X**, in **Safari** **Preferences**:

In **iOS**, In **Settings** / **Safari**:

I strongly recommend you switch to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for your search needs now. And if you are web smart, feel free to give them [feedback](https://duckduckgo.com/feedback) or [get involved](http://duckduckhack.com) in making it better.
