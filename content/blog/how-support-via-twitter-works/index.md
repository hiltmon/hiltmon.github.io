Daniel Jalkut asked a question on Twitter


> There are over 2000 items in my Keychain. So if I want to dump/migrate to e.g. @1Password, do I really have to approve every single access?

The gang at [agilebits](https://agilebits.com/) (makers of 1Password) respond with a set of scripts to completely solve his issue, no questions asked:

That, friends, is how Twitter support should and does work.
