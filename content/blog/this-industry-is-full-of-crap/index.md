Lovely rant by Amber Weinberg in [This Industry Is Full of Crap](http://www.amberweinberg.com/this-industry-is-full-of-crap/):

> We get to do something that regular people can’t understand so we’re think we’re cool. We’re not.

And I'm right with her on this too:

> I love the fact that as a freelancer, I can choose who ever I want to work with – both in terms of clients and other freelancers.
