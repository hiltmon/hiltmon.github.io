In short, between the iPad 2 and the new iPad (retina):

* **Weight**: Same
* **Thickness**: Same
* **Screen**: Yowser! The old screen looks pixellated and blurry, the new screen is brilliant. Also a lot warmer.
* **Performance**: Same

Between the original and the new iPad (retina):

* **Weight**: Oh, so much lighter
* **Thickness**: Oh, so much thinner
* **Screen**: As above, but the original was warmer than the iPad 2.
* **Performance**: Blazingly faster, yet the original is still no slouch.
