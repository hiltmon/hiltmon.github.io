Of all the stupid things to do, Hipstamatic fired its 3 devs, 1 designer and writer yesterday. Here’s how it played out on Twitter.

> So in case you didn’t get the memo. Entire team laid off. 3 devs, 1 designer, 1 writer. Some of THE best people I’ve ever worked with…

This is a company making 22 million dollars this year (according to [The Verge here](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/16/3247801/hipstamatic-layoffs-synthetic)). And expects to continue without its creatives!

> @pbowden to be honest I was about to bitch quit anyway…

Then again, it’s not Instagram, and charging for consumables on an iOS app was extreme asshattery!

> And to be frank this is the best thing, it became apparent that we were spiraling the drain.

The good news is that this Twitter stream got a lot of attention and @schwa and team received a lot of new offers.

> Would love if the entire team could get snapped up by someone. Really is an awesome fucking team. Totally squandered where we were.

Mad, frustrating, angry day for a great team that did not deserve it.
