I just downloaded the updated [Pinbrowser for Pinboard](http://www.pinbrowser.co) from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinbrowser-for-pinboard/id611736066?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l894), an iOS app by Mikael Konutgan ([@mkonutgan](http://twitter.com/mkonutgan)), and it just got a whole lot better.

[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) is a *paid for* bookmarking site that focuses on speed, utility and longevity (and anti-socialness!). Pinbrowser is an iPhone and iPad application to access your Pinboard, other's bookmarks (making it more social) and the all famous [popular bookmarks list](https://pinboard.in/popular/).

It's the social aspect that attracted me to the product in the first place. I love to see what other people I follow on Twitter and App.Net are finding on the Internet in their travels, and the ability to browse their Pinboard lists is the *stand-out* feature of [Pinbrowser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinbrowser-for-pinboard/id611736066?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l894).

In this release, Mikael has gotten down to spotlighting the key uses of the application by adding new icons to separate the standard sidebar items from user added ones, a **Me** list for your own bookmarks (strangely missing from the original) and a lovely new feature, the **All Starred** list. Oh, and the new icon is brilliant!

If you use Pinboard, [Pinbrowser for Pinboard on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinbrowser-for-pinboard/id611736066?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l894) for the iPhone or iPad is a lovely *one-thing-well* app that you should consider.
