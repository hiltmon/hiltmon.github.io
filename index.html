This is an editor panel to the right of the main editor where you are working that automatically (and somewhat magically) displays the counterpart to the file you are editing. So for example if I am working on service.cpp, the assistant displays its header service.h.
This is great for productivity. I can glance to the right to see the declarations that I am implementing, and can change both declaration and definition directly without opening or changing contexts.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2023/03/03/xcodes-assistant-editor-struggling-with-cpp/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Feb 11, 2023 1:08 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2023/02/11/zero-to-one-stages-of-startup-development/>Zero to One: Stages of Startup Development</a></h1><p class=summary-body>The challenge has been set, the startup has been formed, and initial release objectives defined. Now what?
How do we get from Zero (a clean slate) to One (first release)? What do we do first? When do we do it? How many people will be needed? And when do we need the funding for it?
In this post, I will outline the four (4) stages of development needed, and the strategy I will be following this year in our new startup, going from Zero to One.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2023/02/11/zero-to-one-stages-of-startup-development/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Jan 1, 2023 11:17 AM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2023/01/01/increasing-file-descriptor-ulimit-on-macos/>Increasing File Descriptor Ulimit on MacOS</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Warning: This post is only for developers who are having issues when coding against file descriptors in the form of C-style file handles or sockets on MacOS.

Running out of Resources Right now I am developing an application that uses sockets (underneath a stack of other software) for inter-process communication. The problem is that after a few debug runs or crashes (I did say developing), the application will not start again from resource starvation.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2023/01/01/increasing-file-descriptor-ulimit-on-macos/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=summary><p class=meta-data><span class=post-date>Dec 21, 2022 2:28 PM</span></p><h1 class=summary-title><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2022/12/21/who-dares-wins/>Who Dares, Wins</a></h1><p class=summary-body>Only a few times in a lifetime does an opportunity come along that could change everything.

It enables users to locate, see, learn and understand what capabilities the software provides.
If users cannot discover a capability, how will they know it exists in the application in the first place?
Designers and developers need to keep this in mind when architecting and structuring applications. They need to not only focus on what is being provided, and how users can use it, but also on how users can find it.</p><p class=read-on><a href=https://hiltmon.com/blog/2022/10/04/hiltmonism-discoverability-is-deserved/>Read on &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=pagination><ul><li class=page-left><a href=https://hiltmon.com/page/2/>&larr; Older</a></li><li class=page-center><a href=https://hiltmon.com/archives/>Blog Archives</a></li></ul></div></section><aside id=sidebar><script async type=text/javascript src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYI52JE&placement=hiltmoncom" id=_carbonads_js></script><section><div id=carbonads></div>&nbsp;</section><section><h1>The Hiltmon Dot Com</h1><p><strong>Hilton Lipschitz</strong> is Cofounder and CTO of <a href=https://openyld.com>OpenYield</a>, building the next generation Bond Marketplace.
